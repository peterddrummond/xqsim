@article{Marino_2022,
	abstract = {We overview the concept of dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) in isolated quantum systems quenched out of equilibrium. We focus on non-equilibrium transitions characterized by an order parameter, which features qualitatively distinct temporal behavior on the two sides of a certain dynamical critical point. DPTs are currently mostly understood as long-lived prethermal phenomena in a regime where inelastic collisions are incapable to thermalize the system. The latter enables the dynamics to substain phases that explicitly break detailed balance and therefore cannot be encompassed by traditional thermodynamics. Our presentation covers both cold atoms as well as condensed matter systems. We revisit a broad plethora of platforms exhibiting pre-thermal DPTs, which become theoretically tractable in a certain limit, such as for a large number of particles, large number of order parameter components, or large spatial dimension. The systems we explore include, among others, quantum magnets with collective interactions, ϕ 4 quantum field theories, and Fermi--Hubbard models. A section dedicated to experimental explorations of DPTs in condensed matter and AMO systems connects this large variety of theoretical models.},

	abstract = {We constructed a large optical computer based on optical parametric oscillators coupled via measurement and feedback. Computers based on physical systems are increasingly anticipated to overcome the impending limitations on digital computer performance. One such computer is a coherent Ising machine (CIM) for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Here, we report a CIM with 100,512 degenerate optical parametric oscillator pulses working as the Ising spins. We show that the CIM delivers fine solutions to maximum cut problems of 100,000-node graphs drastically faster than standard simulated annealing. Moreover, the CIM, when operated near the phase transition point, provides some extremely good solutions and a very broad distribution. This characteristic will be useful for applications that require fast random sampling such as machine learning.},

@article{bulmerBoundaryQuantumAdvantage2022a,
	abstract = {Identifying the boundary beyond which quantum machines provide a computational advantage over their classical counterparts is a crucial step in charting their usefulness. Gaussian boson sampling (GBS), in which photons are measured from a highly entangled Gaussian state, is a leading approach in pursuing quantum advantage. State-of-the-art GBS experiments that run in minutes would require 600 million years to simulate using the best preexisting classical algorithms. Here, we present faster classical GBS simulation methods, including speed and accuracy improvements to the calculation of loop hafnians. We test these on a {$\sim$}100,000-core supercomputer to emulate GBS experiments with up to 100 modes and up to 92 photons. This reduces the simulation time for state-of-the-art GBS experiments to several months, a nine\textendash orders of magnitude improvement over previous estimates. Last, we introduce a distribution that is efficient to sample from classically and that passes a variety of GBS validation methods.           ,              Methods are developed and benchmarked that substantially reduce the time to simulate cutting-edge quantum optics experiments.},

	abstract = {A programmable quantum computer based on fiber optics outperforms classical computers with a high level of confidence.           ,              Photonics is a promising platform for demonstrating a quantum computational advantage (QCA) by outperforming the most powerful classical supercomputers on a well-defined computational task. Despite this promise, existing proposals and demonstrations face challenges. Experimentally, current implementations of Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) lack programmability or have prohibitive loss rates. Theoretically, there is a comparative lack of rigorous evidence for the classical hardness of GBS. In this work, we make progress in improving both the theoretical evidence and experimental prospects. We provide evidence for the hardness of GBS, comparable to the strongest theoretical proposals for QCA. We also propose a QCA architecture we call high-dimensional GBS, which is programmable and can be implemented with low loss using few optical components. We show that particular algorithms for simulating GBS are outperformed by high-dimensional GBS experiments at modest system sizes. This work thus opens the path to demonstrating QCA with programmable photonic processors.},

Gong               et al.               used an 8-by-8 two-dimensional (2D) superconducting qubit square lattice containing 62 functional qubits to show how multiple (two) walkers traverse a 2D qubit array, interfering as they go. The authors were also able to program the paths that the walkers follow, demonstrating a Mach-Zehnder interferometer in which a single or multiple quantum walkers coherently traverse two paths before interfering and exiting at a single port. The results illustrate the potential for superconducting-based quantum processors in simulating large-scale quantum systems.

In our work, we have designed and fabricated an 8-by-8 two-dimensional square superconducting qubit array composed of 62 functional qubits. We used this device to demonstrate high-fidelity single- and two-particle quantum walks. Furthermore, with the high programmability of the quantum processor, we implemented a Mach-Zehnder interferometer where the quantum walker coherently traverses in two paths before interfering and exiting.

	abstract = {Abstract                            A quantum computer attains computational advantage when outperforming the best classical computers running the best-known algorithms on well-defined tasks. No photonic machine offering programmability over all its quantum gates has demonstrated quantum computational advantage: previous machines               1,2               were largely restricted to static gate sequences. Earlier photonic demonstrations were also vulnerable to spoofing               3               , in which classical heuristics produce samples, without direct simulation, lying closer to the ideal distribution than do samples from the quantum hardware. Here~we report quantum computational advantage using Borealis, a photonic processor offering dynamic programmability on all gates implemented. We carry out Gaussian boson sampling               4               (GBS) on 216 squeezed modes entangled with three-dimensional connectivity               5               , using a time-multiplexed and photon-number-resolving architecture. On average, it would take more than 9,000\,years for the best available algorithms and supercomputers to produce, using exact methods, a single sample from the programmed distribution, whereas Borealis requires only 36\,{$\mu$}s. This runtime advantage is over 50 million times as extreme as that reported from earlier photonic machines. Ours constitutes a very large GBS experiment, registering events with up to 219 photons and a mean photon number of 125. This work is a critical milestone on the path to a practical quantum computer, validating key technological features of photonics as a platform for this goal.},

@misc{martinez-cifuentesClassicalModelsAre2022,
	abstract = {Recently, Zhong et al. [Science 370, 1460 (2020), Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 180502 (2021)] performed landmark Gaussian boson sampling experiments with up to 144 modes using threshold detectors. The authors claim to have achieved quantum computational advantage with the implementation of these experiments, named Jiuzhang 1.0 and Jiuzhang 2.0. Their experimental results are validated against several classical hypotheses and adversaries using tests such as the comparison of statistical correlations between modes, Bayesian hypothesis testing and the Heavy Output Generation test. In this work we propose an alternative classical hypothesis for the validation of these experiments. We use the probability distribution of mixtures of coherent states sent into a lossy interferometer; these input mixed states, which we term squashed states, have vacuum fluctuations in one quadrature and excess fluctuations in the other. We find that for configurations in the large photon number density regime, the comparison of statistical correlations does not tell apart the ground truth of the experiment (namely, the probability distribution of two-mode squeezed states sent into a lossy interferometer) from our alternative hypothesis. Moreover, the Bayesian test indicates that our alternative hypothesis is a more likely explanation of the experimental data than the ground truth. Our results indicate that a classical explanation of the experiments of Zhong et al., lacking any quantum features, has not been ruled out.},

@misc{ohSpoofingCrossEntropy2022a,
	abstract = {Cross entropy measure is a widely used benchmarking to demonstrate quantum computational advantage from sampling problems, such as random circuit sampling using superconducting qubits and boson sampling. In this work, we propose a heuristic classical algorithm that generates heavy outcomes of the ideal boson sampling distribution and consequently achieves a large cross entropy. The key idea is that there exist classical samplers that are efficiently simulable and correlate with the ideal boson sampling probability distribution and that the correlation can be used to post-select heavy outcomes of the ideal probability distribution, which essentially leads to a large cross entropy. As a result, our algorithm achieves a large cross entropy score by selectively generating heavy outcomes without simulating ideal boson sampling. We first show that for small-size circuits, the algorithm can even score a better cross entropy than the ideal distribution of boson sampling. We then demonstrate that our method scores a better cross entropy than the recent Gaussian boson sampling experiments when implemented at intermediate, verifiable system sizes. Much like current state-of-the-art experiments, we cannot verify that our spoofer works for quantum advantage size systems. However, we demonstrate our approach works for much larger system sizes in fermion sampling, where we can efficiently compute output probabilities.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter describes general properties of pupils with nonuniform real or complex amplitude distributions. These general properties are relevant to apodisation. In most optical problems, it is usual to consider only the central part of the diffraction pattern produced by an optical system as the image of a luminous point. In fact, this central part determines the principal performance characteristics of the system, in particular its ability to resolve two equally bright object points. This also determines the spatial frequency transmission curve in the medium frequencies region. In the study of linear structures and in spectroscopy, where the image is that of a slit, it is desirable that the pupil should have a complex amplitude distribution, which is constant along any parallel to the linear direction in the object. A similar situation occurs in the study of polar diagrams of antennae. These are called ``rectilinear cases.''},

This is carried out by means of quasi-classical distribution functions and here we address the question of which is the best choice of function from the large selection available. Whereas Glauber's P(agr) distribution is useful in many applications, it does not exist as a well-behaved function in many others. In such cases, a more useful function is the generalized P-representation of Drummond and Gardiner. However, based on simplicity and overall applicability, we conclude that Wigner's function also has a claim to be the optimum choice.},

	abstract = {A review is given on the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method, which is an algorithm for propagating wavepackets. The formal derivation, numerical implementation, and performance of the method are detailed. As demonstrated by example applications, MCTDH may perform very efficiently, especially when there are many (typically four to twelve, say) degrees of freedom. The largest system treated with MCTDH to date is the pyrazine molecule, where all 24 (!) vibrational modes were accounted for. The particular representation of the MCTDH wavefunction requires special techniques for generating an initial wavepacket and for analysing the propagated wavefunction. These techniques are discussed. The full efficiency of the MCTDH method is only realised if the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of products of one-dimensional operators. The kinetic energy operator and many model potential functions already have this required structure. For other potential!
  functions, we describe an efficient algorithm for determining optimal fits of product form. An alternative to the product representation, the correlation discrete variable representation (CDVR) method, is also briefly discussed.},

In general, a priori unknown states can be completely determined only when measurements on infinite ensembles of identically prepared quantum systems are performed. But how one can estimate (guess) quantum state when just incomplete data are available (known)? What is the most reliable estimation based on a given measured data? What is the optimal measurement providing only a finite number of identically prepared quantum objects are available? These are some of the questions we address. We present several schemes for a reconstruction of states of quantum systems from measured data: (1) We show how the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) principle can be efficiently used for an estimation of quantum states on incomplete observation levels. (2) We show how Bayesian inference can be used for reconstruct!
 ion of quantum states when only a finite number of identically prepared systems are measured. (3) We describe the optimal generalized measurement of a finite number of identically prepared quantum systems which results in the estimation of a quantum state with the highest fidelity. },

By making use of the well-known equivalence of Fokker-Planck and Ito stochastic equations, we demonstrate two alternative methods for formulating the equations of motion as coupled stochastic c-number equations for the propagating field. The first method involves a representation of the density operator in terms of the positive P distribution function. This leads to exact stochastic equations of motion.

The photon statistics of the light in the cavity are investigated through a calculation of the second-order correlation function of the light field in the steady state. For a coherent driving field the field inside the cavity will exhibit photon antibunching for low intensities. As the fluctuations in the driving field are increased the photon antibunching is lost. For a particular coherent field, g (2) (0) is reduced with increasing laser intensity. This reduction with laser intensity is slower with increasing laser amplitude fluctuations.

The positive distribution introduced by Drummond and Gardiner (1981) in the context of the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation is shown to arise as a special case. One can thus associate a positive distribution to the Wigner function such that its moments give the averages of Weyl-ordered operators with respect to the given density operator. It is also found that one can associate to the Glauber-Sudarshan P-function, a distribution in the extended space which, though not positive, interestingly, involves the Wigner function (1932).

The largest spectral noise reductions are predicted to occur with a very high-Q second-harmonic cavity. Our analytic results agree well with stochastic numerical simulations.

We calculate commonly used measures of quantum behavior including entanglement, squeezing, and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations as well as higher order tripartite correlations, and show how these are mod!

Multiphoton processes occur and are important for many aspects of matter-radiation interactions that include the efficient ionization of atoms and molecules, and, more generally, atomic transition mechanisms; system-environment couplings and dissipative quantum dynamics; laser physics, optical parametric processes, and interferometry. A single review cannot account for all aspects of such an enormously vast subject. Here we choose to concentrate our attention on parametric processes in nonlinear media, with special emphasis on the engineering of nonclassical states of photons and atoms that are relevant for the conceptual investigations as well as for the practical applications of forefront aspects of modern quantum mechanics. We present a detailed analysis of the methods and techniques for the production of genuinely quantum multiphoton processes in nonlinear media, and t!

We review existing proposals for the classification, engineering, and manipulation of nonclassical states, including Fock states, macroscopic superposition states, and multiphoton generalized coherent states. We introduce and discuss the structure of canonical multiphoton quantum optics and the associated one- and two-mode canonical multiphoton squeezed states. This framework provides a consistent multiphoton generalization of two-photon quantum optics and a consistent Hamiltonian description of multiphoton processes associated to higher-order nonlinearities. Finally, we discuss very recent advances that by combining linear and nonlinear optical devices allow to realize multiphoton entangled states of the electromagnetic field, either in discrete or in continuous variables, that are relevant for applications to efficient quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and related problems in quantum communication an!

A generalized version of the Cahill and Glauber s-ordered displacement operator displacing the annihilation and creation operators by {\^I}$\pm$ and {\^I}² is defined. Corresponding to this n/Inondiagonal displacement, a nondiagonal ordering operator is introduced so that a map of s-ordered operators into c numbers $\hat{a}${\^a}{\^I}$\pm$, $\hat{a}^\dagger{\^a}{\^I}²$ can be defined. The Drummond-Gardiner projector and the Cahill-Glauber diagonal ordering operator are obtained as particular cases. In order to use the nondiagonal correspondence in the determination of quantum expectation values of observables, several families of quasiprobabilities are defined, generalizing Drummond-Gardiner (normal order and nondiagonal)!
  positive-P-function and Cahill-Glauber (s-order and diagonal) quasiprobabilities. It is demonstrated that these nondiagonal quasiprobabilities exist as well-behaved functions where at least one is non-negative, for any state and any order. The time evolution of these quasiprobabilities is discussed both in the Schr{\"o}dinger and in the Heisenberg pictures. In the Heisenberg picture, a method for obtaining c-number stochastic differential equations (SDE's) directly from operator equations using the s-order nondiagonal correspondence is described. The main difference between this method and the Langevin approach is that in the latter a diagonal correspondence is used, leading eventually to wrong results. The use of these SDE's to solve quantum optical problems is discussed, and an application to the nonlinearly damped degenerate parametric oscillator is made. In order to obtain the SDE, various (inequivalent) truncation schemes are necessary.},

Even this, however, is hardly practicable when one has to deal with very many electrons, so that one then requires a still simpler and rougher method. Such a method is provided by Thomas' atomic model, in which the electrons are regarded as forming a perfect gas satisfying the Fermi statistics and occupying the region of phase space of lowest energy. This region of phase space is assumed to be saturated, with two electrons with opposite spins in each volume $(2 \pi \hbar )^3$, and the remainder is assumed to be empty.

HBT correlations, together with their fermionic counterparts find numerous applications, ranging from quantum optics to nuclear and elementary particle physics. Spatial HBT interferometry has been suggested as a means to probe hidden order in strongly correlated phases of ultracold atoms. Here we report such a measurement on the Mott insulator phase of a rubidium Bose gas as it is released from an optical lattice trap. We show that strong periodic quantum correlations exist between density fluctuations in the expanding atom cloud. These spatial correlations reflect the underlying ordering in the lattice, and find a natural interpretation in terms of a multiple-wav!

This enables chemical master equations to be transformed into Fokker-Planck and stochastic differential equations and yields very simple descriptions of chemical equilibrium states. Certain nonequilibrium systems are investigated and the results are compared with those obtained previously. The Gaussian approximation is investigated and is found to be valid almost always, except near critical points. The stochastic differential equations derived have a few novel features, such as the possibility of pure imaginary noise terms and the possibility of higher order noise, which do not seem to have been previously studied by physicists. These features are allowable because the transform of the probability distribution is a quasiprobability, which may be negative or even complex.},

@article{Gilles:1997,
	abstract = {The degenerate parametric oscillator above threshold is studied with phenomenological stochastic colored (nonwhite) pump noise for arbitrary pump to subharmonic relaxation rate. The current experimental limits of large intracavity threshold photon numbers (very small quantum noise) are considered, allowing for a semiclassical treatment of the system dynamics. A comparison between the effects of isotropic and squeezed pump noise on the internal transient and steady-state fluctuations is presented by simulation of the nonlinear semiclassical stochastic Langevin equations in the Wigner quadrature representation. It is found that the transient squeezing for the system starting in the unstable steady state (the vacuum) is not degraded by stochastic pump noise. A damped oscillatory behavior of the noise levels (periodic exchange of fluctuations between the squeezed quadrature of the signal and the pump) is observed for large damping of the signal in the turn on of pum!
 p depletion. Finally, it is shown that the limited squeezing above threshold in the steady state (50\%) due to pump depletion can be enhanced if squeezed stochastic noise with sufficient significant spectral components (broadband squeezing) is fed to the pump. The above-threshold steady-state squeezing has been calculated analytically from the linearized stochastic equations and the effects of the time scale associated to the relaxation of the pump noise (the noise correlation time) compared to the dissipative time scale of the system and the pump to subharmonic loss ratio are presented. },

@article{Grond,
	abstract = {Interferometry with ultracold atoms promises the possibility of ultraprecise and ultrasensitive measurements in many fields of physics, and is the basis of our most precise atomic clocks. Key to a high sensitivity is the possibility to achieve long measurement times and precise readout. Ultracold atoms can be precisely manipulated at the quantum level and can be held for very long times in traps; they would therefore be an ideal setting for interferometry. In this paper, we discuss how the nonlinearities from atom-atom interactions, on the one hand, allow us to efficiently produce squeezed states for enhanced readout and, on the other hand, result in phase diffusion that limits the phase accumulation time. We find that low-dimensional geometries are favorable, with two-dimensional (2D) settings giving the smallest contribution of phase diffusion caused by atom-atom interactions. Even for time sequences generated by optimal control, the achievable minimal detecta!
 ble interaction energy $\Delta E^{min}$ is of the order of $10^{-4} \mu$, where $\mu$ is the chemical potential of the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in the trap. From these we have to conclude that for more precise measurements with atom interferometers, more sophisticated strategies, or turning off the interaction-induced dephasing during the phase accumulation stage, will be necessary.},

We demonstrate that STIRAP is still feasible when we include the spatial degrees of freedom that cause the Bose-enhanced coupling rate to vary across the condensate.

The superconducting correlations of the dx2-y2 wave symmetry in the ground state at distance r decays essentially as inverse cubic of r. The upper bound of the correlation at long distances estimated by this unbiased method is 0.001, indicating that recent extensions of dynamical mean-field theories and variational methods yielded at least an order of magnitude overestimates of it. The correlations are too weak for the realistic account of the cuprate high-Tc superconductivity. },

@article{Jeltes:2007,
	abstract = {Fifty years ago, Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) discovered photon bunching in light emitted by a chaotic source, highlighting the importance of two-photon correlations and stimulating the development of modern quantum optics. The quantum interpretation of bunching relies on the constructive interference between amplitudes involving two indistinguishable photons, and its additive character is intimately linked to the Bose nature of photons. Advances in atom cooling and detection have led to the observation and full characterization of the atomic analogue of the HBT effect with bosonic atoms. By contrast, fermions should reveal an antibunching effect (a tendency to avoid each other). Antibunching of fermions is associated with destructive two-particle interference, and is related to the Pauli principle forbidding more than one identical fermion to occupy the same quantum state. Here we report an experimental comparison of the fermionic and bosonic HBT effects in th!
 e same apparatus, using two different isotopes of helium: 3He (a fermion) and 4He (a boson). Ordinary attractive or repulsive interactions between atoms are negligible; therefore, the contrasting bunching and antibunching behaviour that we observe can be fully attributed to the different quantum statistics of each atomic species. Our results show how atom--atom correlation measurements can be used to reveal details in the spatial density or momentum correlations in an atomic ensemble. They also enable the direct observation of phase effects linked to the quantum statistics of a many-body system, which may facilitate the study of more exotic situations.},

We directly image the Fermi surface of the atoms in the lattice by turning off the optical lattice adiabatically. Because of the confining potential, gradual filling of the lattice transforms the system from a normal state into a band insulator. The dynamics of the transition from a band insulator to a normal state is studied, and the time scale is measured to be an order of magnitude larger than the tunneling time in the lattice. Using a Feshbach resonance, we increase the interaction between atoms in two different spin states and dynamically induce a coupling between the lowest energy bands. We observe a shift of this coupling with respect to the Feshbach resonance in free space which is anticipated for strongly confined atoms.},

For this purpose the Stokes-parameter operators and the associated Poincar{\'e} sphere, which describe the quantum-optical polarization properties of light, are defined and their basic properties are reviewed. The general features of the Stokes operators are illustrated by evaluation of their means and variances for a range of simple polarization states. Some of the examples show polarization squeezing, in which the variances of one or more Stokes parameters are smaller than the coherent-state value. The main object of the paper is the application of these concepts to bright squeezed light. It is shown that a light beam formed by interference of two orthogonally polarized quadrature-squeezed beams exhibits squeezing in some of the Stokes parameters. Passage of such a primary polarization-squeezed beam through suitable optical components generates a pair of polarization-entangled light ! beams with the nature of a two-mode squeezed state. Implementation of these schemes using the double-fiber Sagnac interferometer provides an efficient method for the generation of bright nonclassical polarization states. The important advantage of these nonclassical polarization states for quantum communication is the possibility of experimentally determining all of the relevant conjugate variables of both squeezed and entangled fields using only linear optical elements followed by direct detection.},

We investigate this possibility by performing numerical simulations of quantum stochastic equations derived using the positive P representation. The equations allow for finite signal cavity loss. Interference fringes which indicate the existence of the macroscopic superposition states are indeed predicted in regimes where the parametric nonlinearity is sufficiently large compared to the signal cavity losses. Experimental criteria needed for the generation of macroscopic quantum superposition states using parametric oscillation are thus established.},

We generalize the CC method to the time domain while allowing the single-particle functions to vary in an adaptive fashion as well, thereby creating a highly flexible, polynomially scaling approximation to the time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation. The method inherits size-consistency and extensivity from the CC method. The method is dubbed orbital-adaptive time-dependent coupled-cluster, and is a hierarchy of approximations to the now standard multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree method for fermions.

Although the first attempts to apply these ideas to quantum problems have also been made in the middle of this century, serious Quantum Monte Carlo simulations started only one to two decades ago. Quite a few Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms have been developed in the meantime. Although they are very different in technical details, the basic ideas are very similar in all of them. The purpose of this review article is twofold. Firstly, we will give an overview of the most commonly used Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. It will give enough background to understand the principles of these methods, their strengths and weaknesses. Secondly, the most important physical results for many-body problems in solid state physics, obtained by QMC simulations, will be presented. It is impossible to cover all QMC applications in this review article and a - to!

The measure of second-order coherence is then introduced in connection with the analysis of a simple interference experiment and some of the more important second-order coherence effects are studied. Their uses in stellar interferometry and interference spectroscopy are described. Analysis of partial polarization from the standpoint of correlation theory is also outlined. The general statistical description of the field is discussed in some detail. The recently discovered universal \textquotedblleft diagonal  \textquotedblright  representation of the density operator for free f!

Later sections, dealing with fourth- and higher-order coherence effects include a discussion of the photoelectric detection process. Among the fourth-order effects described in detail are bunching phenomena, the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect and its application to astronomy.

We show that feasible computational strategies are determined mainly by the eigenstructure of the system of stochastic differential equations that correspond to the positive-P Fokker-Planck equation. We demonstrate analytically that the stability and accuracy of numerical solutions are generally much improved by adopting time-centered implicit schemes. These findings are then related to the specific problem of second-harmonic generation. It is shown that the eigenstructure of the stochastic system possesses interrelationships that can lead to severe difficulties in numerical simulations. In particular we show how the problem of ``spiking'' encountered at high levels of quantum noise can be related to the numerical ``stiffness'' of the problem. We also demonstrate the advantages of time-centered implicit methods by highlighting the distort!
 ions that can occur in the Euler-type simulation of limit cycle solutions. Of physical interest is the fact that the phase-space morphology of the quantized second-harmonic generator admits families of limit cycles. This is in marked contrast to the purely classical picture in which, for a given parameter set, there exists only a single limit cycle. Finally we demonstrate by direct analytic solution that, under the conditions of adiabatic elimination, the positive-P representation for the second-harmonic generator with zero driving field fails, in the sense that it produces nonphysical results. This failure is in all respects analogous to the breakdown encountered in the problem of nonlinear optical damping.},

The non-positive-definite second-order terms in the quantum evolution equation, not present in the classical case, are responsible for quantum recurrences and prevent the appearance of fine-scale-structure   \textquotedblleft whorls  \textquotedblright predicted in a classical description.

	abstract = {A Gaussian operator basis provides a means to formulate phase-space simulations of the real- and imaginary-time evolution of quantum systems. Such simulations are guaranteed to be exact while the underlying distribution remains well-bounded, which defines a useful simulation time. We analyse the application of the Gaussian phase-space representation to the dynamics of the dissociation of an ultra-cold molecular gas. We show how the choice of mapping to stochastic differential equations can be used to tailor the stochastic behaviour, and thus the useful simulation time. In the phase-space approach, it is only averages of stochastic trajectories that have a direct physical meaning. Whether particular constants of the motion are satisfied by individual trajectories depends on the choice of mapping, as we show in examples.},

	abstract = {We perform a quantum-mechanical analysis of the pendular cavity, using the positive-P representation, showing that the quantum state of the moving mirror, a macroscopic object, has noticeable effects on the dynamics. This system has previously been proposed as a candidate for the quantum-limited measurement of small displacements of the mirror due to radiation pressure, for the production of states with entanglement between the mirror and the field, and even for superposition states of the mirror. However, when we treat the oscillating mirror quantum mechanically, we find that it always oscillates, has no stationary steady state, and exhibits uncertainties in position and momentum which are typically larger than the mean values. This means that previous linearized fluctuation analyses which have been used to predict these highly quantum states are of limited use. We find that the achievable accuracy in measurement is far worse than the standard quantum limit due!

Computationally, these SDEs are attractive because they seem simple to simulate. They can be quite unstable, however. In this paper, we consider some of the instabilities and propose a few remedies. Particularly, because the variances of the simulated paths typically grow exponentially, the p!
 rocesses become de-localized in relatively short times. Hence, the issues of boundary conditions and stable integration methods become important. We use the Bose-Einstein Hamiltonian as an example. Our results reveal that it is possible to significantly extend integration times and show the periodic structure of certain functionals.},

The relationship with entanglement and Bell's theorem are analyzed, and the progress to date towards experimental confirmation of the EPR paradox is summarized, with a detailed treatment of the continuous-variable paradox in laser-based experiments. Practical techniques covered include continuous-wave parametric amplifier and optical fiber quantum soliton experiments. Current proposals for extending EPR experiments to massive-particle systems are discussed, including spin squeezing, atomic position entanglement, and quadrature entanglement in ultracold atoms. Finally, applications of this technology to quantum key distribution, quantum teleportation, and entanglement swapping are e!

The quantum fields of both the molecules and atoms are simulated from first principles in three dimensions using the positive-P representation method. This allows us to provide an exact treatment of the molecular field depletion and s-wave scattering interactions between the particles, as well as to extend the analysis to nonuniform systems. In the simplest uniform case, we find that the major source of atom-atom decorrelation is atom-atom recombination which produces molecules outside the initially occupied condensate mode. The unwanted molecules are formed from dissociated atom pairs with nonopposite momenta. The net effect of this process---which becomes increasingly significant for dissociation durations corresponding to more than about 40\% conversion---is to!
  reduce the atom-atom correlations. In addition, for nonuniform systems we find that mode mixing due to inhomogeneity can result in further degradation of the correlation signal. We characterize the correlation strength via the degree of squeezing of particle number-difference fluctuations in a certain momentum-space volume and show that the correlation strength can be increased if the signals are binned into larger counting volumes.},

The second class of the spin distributions is constructed with the help of the spin coherent states. The connection of the spin coherent states to the Stratonovich formalism is established and discussed. It is shown that the c-number phase-space description of quantum fluctuations provides a simple statistical picture of quantum fluctuations of spinoperators in terms of random directions on a unit sphere. For quantum states of the spin system the statistics of these random orientations is given by non-positive spin quasi-distribution functions.

The algorithm can be used for studying the properties of nonlinear quantum or classical field theories. The general approach is outlined and applied to a specific example, namely the quantum statistical fluctuations of ultra-short optical pulses in {\oe}{\'a}(2)parametric waveguides. This example uses a non-diagonal coherent state representation, and correctly predicts the sub-shot noise level spectral fluctuations observed in homodyne detection measurements. It is expected that the methods used will be applicable for higher-order c!

Many such problems defined as computationally difficult can be mathematically mapped onto the so-called Ising problem, which looks at finding the minimum energy configuration for an array of coupled spins. Inagaki et al. and McMahon et al. show that an optical processing approach based on a network of coupled optical pulses in a ring fiber can be used to model and optimize large-scale Ising systems. Such a scalable architecture could help to optimize solutions to a wide range of complex problems.Science, this issue pp. 603 and 614The analysis and optimization of complex systems can be reduced to mathematical problems collectively known as combinatorial optimization. Many such problems can be mapped onto ground-state search problems of the Ising model, and various artificial spin systems are now emerging as promising approaches. However, physical Ising machines have suffered from limited numbers of spin-spin couplings because of implementations based on localized spins, resulting in severe scalability problems. We report a 2000-spin network with all-to-all spin-spin couplings. Using a measurement and feedback scheme, we coupled time-multiplexed degenerate optical parametric oscillators to implement maximum cut problems on arbitrary graph topologies with up to 2000 nodes. Our coherent Ising machine outperformed simulated annealing in terms of accuracy and computation time for a 2000-node complete graph.},

	abstract = {Quantum annealing aims at solving combinatorial optimization problems mapped to Ising interactions between quantum spins. Here, with the objective of developing a noise-resilient annealer, we propose a paradigm for quantum annealing with a scalable network of two-photon-driven Kerr-nonlinear resonators. Each resonator encodes an Ising spin in a robust degenerate subspace formed by two coherent states of opposite phases. A fully connected optimization problem is mapped to local fields driving the resonators, which are connected with only local four-body interactions. We describe an adiabatic annealing protocol in this system and analyse its performance in the presence of photon loss. Numerical simulations indicate substantial resilience to this noise channel, leading to a high success probability for quantum annealing. Finally, we propose a realistic circuit QED implementation of this promising platform for implementing a large-scale quantum Ising machine.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of nonlinear systems qualitatively change depending on their parameters, which is called bifurcation. A quantum-mechanical nonlinear oscillator can yield a quantum superposition of two oscillation states, known as a Schr{\"o}dinger cat state, via quantum adiabatic evolution through its bifurcation point. Here we propose a quantum computer comprising such quantum nonlinear oscillators, instead of quantum bits, to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems. The nonlinear oscillator network finds optimal solutions via quantum adiabatic evolution, where nonlinear terms are increased slowly, in contrast to conventional adiabatic quantum computation or quantum annealing, where quantum fluctuation terms are decreased slowly. As a result of numerical simulations, it is concluded that quantum superposition and quantum fluctuation work effectively to find optimal solutions. It is also notable that the present computer is analogous to neural computers, which are also networks of nonlinear components. Thus, the present scheme will open new possibilities for quantum computation, nonlinear science and artificial intelligence.},

	abstract = {Signal transmission loss in a quantum network can be overcome by encoding quantum states in complex multiphoton fields. But transmitting quantum information encoded in this way requires that locally stored states can be converted to propagating fields. Here we experimentally show the controlled conversion of multiphoton quantum states, such as Schr{\"o}dinger cat states, from a microwave cavity quantum memory into propagating modes. By parametric conversion using the nonlinearity of a single Josephson junction, we can release the cavity state in ∼500 ns, about three orders of magnitude faster than its intrinsic lifetime. This mechanism---which we dub Schr{\"o}dinger's catapult---faithfully converts arbitrary cavity fields to travelling signals with an estimated efficiency of >90{\%}, enabling the on-demand generation of complex itinerant quantum states. Importantly, the release process can be precisely controlled on fast timescales, allowing us to generate entanglement between the cavity and the travelling mode by partial conversion.},

	abstract = {We discuss general properties of discrete time quantum symmetry breaking in degenerate parametric oscillators. Recent experiments in superconducting quantum circuit with Josephson junction nonlinearities give rise to new properties of strong parametric coupling and nonlinearities. Exact analytic solutions are obtained for the steady-state of this single-mode case of subharmonic generation. We also obtain analytic solutions for the tunneling time over which the time symmetry-breaking is lost above threshold. We find that additional anharmonic terms found in the superconducting case increase the tunneling rate, and can also lead to new regimes of tristability as well as bistability. Our analytic results are confirmed by number state calculations.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the generation of superpositions of coherent states with opposite phases, the so-called photonic Schr\"{o}dinger cat states. These experiments are challenging, and, so far, cats involving only small photon numbers have been implemented. Here, we propose to consider two-mode squeezed states as examples of Schr\"{o}dinger cat-like states. For this, we apply criteria that aim to identify macroscopic superpositions in a more general sense. We extend some of these criteria to the two-mode continuous variable regime. Furthermore, we compare the size of states obtained in several experiments and discuss experimental challenges for further improvements. Our results not only promote two-mode squeezed states for exploring quantum effects at the macroscopic level but also provide direct measures to evaluate their usefulness for quantum metrology.},

The idea remained an academic curiosity until the 1980s when it was proposed2,3,4 that, under suitable conditions, a macroscopic object with many microscopic degrees of freedom could behave quantum mechanically, provided that it was sufficiently decoupled from its environment. Although much progress has been made in demonstrating the macroscopic quantum behaviour of various systems such as superconductors5,6,7,8,9, nanoscale magnets10,11,12, laser-cooled trapped ions13, photons in a microwave cavity14 and C60 molecules15, there has been no experimental demonstration of a quantum superposition of truly macroscopically distinct states. Here we present experimental evidence that a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) can be put into a superposition of two magnetic-flux states: one corresponding to a few microamperes of current flowing clockwise, the other corresponding to the same amount of current flowing anticlockwise.},

	abstract = {A Bose--Einstein condensate represents the most `classical'form of a matter wave, just as an optical laser emits the most classical form of an electromagnetic wave. Nevertheless, the matter wave field has a quantized structure owing to the granularity of the discrete underlying atoms. Although such a field is usually assumed to be intrinsically stable (apart from incoherent loss processes), this is no longer true when the condensate is in a coherent superposition of different atom number states1,2,3,4,5,6. For example, in a Bose--Einstein condensate confined by a three-dimensional optical lattice, each potential well can be prepared in a coherent superposition of different atom number states, with constant relative phases between neighbouring lattice sites. It is then natural to ask how the individual matter wave fields and their relative phases evolve. Here we use such a set-up to investigate these questions experimentally, observing that the matter wave field of the Bose--Einstein condensate undergoes a periodic series of collapses and revivals; this behaviour is directly demonstrated in the dynamical evolution of the multiple matter wave interference pattern. We attribute the oscillations to the quantized structure of the matter wave field and the collisions between individual atoms.},

Examples include Ramsey interferometry in atomic spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction in crystallography and optical interferometry in gravitational-wave studies1,2. It has been known for some time that the quantum property of entanglement can be exploited to perform super-sensitive measurements, for example in optical interferometry or atomic spectroscopy3,4,5,6,7. The idea has been demonstrated for an entangled state of two photons8, but for larger numbers of particles it is difficult to create the necessary multiparticle entangled states9,10,11. Here we demonstrate experimentally a technique for producing a maximally entangled three-photon state from initially non-entangled photons. The method can in principle be applied to generate states of arbitrary photon number, giving arbitrarily large improvement in measurement resolution12,13,14,15. The method of state construction requires non-unitary operations, which we perform using post-selected linear-optics techniques similar to those used for linear-optics quantum computing16,17,18,19,20.},

	abstract = {Superposition is one of the most distinctive features of quantum theory and has been demonstrated in numerous single-particle interference experiments1,2,3,4. Quantum entanglement5, the coherent superposition of states in multi-particle systems, yields more complex phenomena6,7. One important type of multi-particle experiment uses path-entangled number states, which exhibit pure higher-order interference and the potential for applications in metrology and imaging8; these include quantum interferometry and spectroscopy with phase sensitivity at the Heisenberg limit9,10,11,12, or quantum lithography beyond the classical diffraction limit13. It has been generally understood14 that in optical implementations of such schemes, lower-order interference effects always decrease the overall performance at higher particle numbers. Such experiments have therefore been limited to two photons15,16,17,18. Here we overcome this limitation, demonstrating a four-photon interferometer based on linear optics. We observe interference fringes with a periodicity of one-quarter of the single-photon wavelength, confirming the presence of a four-particle mode-entangled state. We anticipate that this scheme should be extendable to arbitrary photon numbers, holding promise for realizable applications with entanglement-enhanced performance.},

	abstract = {Schr{\"o}dinger's hypothetical cat was both dead and alive thanks to a paradox of quantum mechanics, in which a system exists in two or more states at once in a `superposition'of entangled states. Creating this situation experimentally is very difficult, especially for systems made up of many particles, as interactions with the environment destroy superposition in a process called decoherence. So far, entangled states of just a handful of atoms or photons have been achieved. Now, two groups have extended the limits of quantum state engineering by creating the largest entangled atomic systems to date. Working with atoms held in an ion trap by an electromagnetic field to limit decoherence, a team from the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado, has created `cat states'of up to six beryllium atoms. A second group, based at Innsbruck University in Austria, has achieved a similar feat by making a related entangled state, a `W state', containing up to eight particles. As the states are created `on demand'and should be scalable to many more particles, there is hope that this technology will pave the way for building a large-scale quantum computer.},

@article{Afek879,
	abstract = {Entanglement, where a system can be in a superposition of a number of distinct states simultaneously, is a principle at the foundation of quantum mechanics (recall Schr{\"o}dinger{\textquoteright}s cat, which is both dead and alive). It can also be used in many applications{\textemdash}imaging, communication, patterning, and metrology{\textemdash}with the effect being amplified by entangling larger systems. However, the systematic generation of {\textquotedblleft}large{\textquotedblright} entangled systems is challenging. Afek et al. (p. 879; see the Perspective by Wildfeuer) present a technique for generating many-photon entanglement in so-called NOON states, where there are two possible paths and N photons in one path and 0 in the other{\textemdash}the system being a superposition of {\textquotedblleft}all and nothing{\textquotedblright} states. Mixing of entangled pairs with classical light at a beam splitter formed up to five photon-entangled states. The technique should be generally applicable to generate higher-order entangled states.Precision measurements can be brought to their ultimate limit by harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics. In optics, multiphoton entangled states, known as NOON states, can be used to obtain high-precision phase measurements, becoming more and more advantageous as the number of photons grows. We generated {\textquotedblleft}high-NOON{\textquotedblright} states (N = 5) by multiphoton interference of quantum down-converted light with a classical coherent state in an approach that is inherently scalable. Super-resolving phase measurements with up to five entangled photons were produced with a visibility higher than that obtainable using classical light only.},

@article{Lavoie_2009,
	abstract = {It is well known that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local realistic theories. Svetlichny showed, through the development of a Bell-like inequality, that quantum mechanics is also incompatible with a restricted class of nonlocal realistic theories for three particles where any two-body nonlocal correlations are allowed (Svetlichny 1987 Physical Review D 35 3066). In the present work, we experimentally generate three-photon GHZ states to test Svetlichny's inequality. Our states are fully characterized by quantum state tomography using an overcomplete set of measurements and have a fidelity of (84$\pm$1)% with the target state. We measure a convincing, 3.6σ, violation of Svetlichny's inequality and rule out this class of restricted nonlocal realistic models.},

	abstract = {We present an exact quantum theory of a model of a parametrically driven dissipative anharmonic oscillator. The model describes a Kerr interaction of an intracavity signal mode which is parametrically excited by a strong driving field via the process of frequency down conversion. Our analysis deals with the nonlinear treatment of light quantum fluctuations and hence allows to study qualitative effects in the transition from slightly perturbed classical behavior to a manifestly quantum mechanical behavior. We find an exact analytical steady-state solution of the Fokker-Planck equation in complex P-representation and calculate (i) normally ordered operator moments and (ii) the photon number probability distribution function of the generated signal field. The critical role of quantum noise in the nonlinear dynamics and in the quantum statistical properties of the signal field is demonstrated. The disappearance of characteristic threshold behavior is shown in the case of large nonlinearities or of increasing quantum noise strength. The ability of the nonlinear system to produce quadrature-squeezed and sub-Poissonian states is demonstrated as well.},

@article{Drummond_generalizedP1980,
	abstract = {A class of normal ordering representations of quantum operators is introduced, that generalises the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation by using nondiagonal coherent state projection operators. These are shown to have practical application to the solution of quantum mechanical master equations. Different representations have different domains of integration, on a complex extension of the usual canonical phase-space. The 'complex P-representation' is the case in which analytic P-functions are defined and normalised on contours in the complex plane. In this case, exact steady-state solutions can often be obtained, even when this is not possible using the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation. The 'positive P-representation' is the case in which the domain is the whole complex phase-space. In this case the P-function may always be chosen positive, and any Fokker-Planck equation arising can be chosen to have a positive-semidefinite diffusion array. Thus the 'positive P-representation' is a genuine probability distribution. The new representations are especially useful in cases of nonclassical statistics.},

@article{Mirrahimi_NJP2014,
	abstract = {We present a new hardware-efficient paradigm for universal quantum computation which is based on encoding, protecting and manipulating quantum information in a quantum harmonic oscillator. This proposal exploits multi-photon driven dissipative processes to encode quantum information in logical bases composed of Schr{\"o}dinger cat states. More precisely, we consider two schemes. In a first scheme, a two-photon driven dissipative process is used to stabilize a logical qubit basis of two-component Schr{\"o}dinger cat states. While such a scheme ensures a protection of the logical qubit against the photon dephasing errors, the prominent error channel of single-photon loss induces bit-flip type errors that cannot be corrected. Therefore, we consider a second scheme based on a four-photon driven dissipative process which leads to the choice of four-component Schr{\"o}dinger cat states as the logical qubit. Such a logical qubit can be protected against single-photon loss by continuous photon number parity measurements. Next, applying some specific Hamiltonians, we provide a set of universal quantum gates on the encoded qubits of each of the two schemes. In particular, we illustrate how these operations can be rendered fault-tolerant with respect to various decoherence channels of participating quantum systems. Finally, we also propose experimental schemes based on quantum superconducting circuits and inspired by methods used in Josephson parametric amplification, which should allow one to achieve these driven dissipative processes along with the Hamiltonians ensuring the universal operations in an efficient manner.},

	abstract = {The control and manipulation of quantum information based on superconducting circuits is an attractive route because of the possibility of scale-up. Vlastakis et al. (p. 607, published online 26 September; see the Perspective by Leek) were able to generate and control quantum entanglement between a superconducting qubit and hundreds of photons stored in a cavity resonator by using deterministic methods for on-demand generation of large Schr{\"o}dinger cat states in a microwave cavity with arbitrary size and phase. The ability to map the state of a qubit to large Schr{\"o}dinger cat states should provide a robust quantum resource in future quantum-based technologies.In contrast to a single quantum bit, an oscillator can store multiple excitations and coherences provided one has the ability to generate and manipulate complex multiphoton states. We demonstrate multiphoton control by using a superconducting transmon qubit coupled to a waveguide cavity resonator with a highly ideal off-resonant coupling. This dispersive interaction is much greater than decoherence rates and higher-order nonlinearities to allow simultaneous manipulation of hundreds of photons. With a tool set of conditional qubit-photon logic, we mapped an arbitrary qubit state to a superposition of coherent states, known as a {\textquotedblleft}cat state.{\textquotedblright} We created cat states as large as 111 photons and extended this protocol to create superpositions of up to four coherent states. This control creates a powerful interface between discrete and continuous variable quantum computation and could enable applications in metrology and quantum information processing.},
