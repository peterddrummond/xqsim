(1) The phase-space simulation code is qusimnet.m, in the SIM folder.

(2) This is called with some parameters. Examples are in the EXAMPLES folder.

(3) There are test scripts: qsim_test**, with different parameters.

(4) There are experimental comparison scripts called qsim_experiment** as well.

(5) Experimental data-files are generated by the qcount.m code.

(6) Read the manuals for details: xGRAPH is a compatible graphics program.
