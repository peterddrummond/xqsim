Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Large, network based experiments in quantum optics are becoming increasingly
 common, pushing the development of networks to ever large sizes.
 These optical linear networks have a variety of applications such as quantum
 computers implementing a type of random-number generation

 and large scale interferometers producing output measurements below the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many implementations use nonclassical inputs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 such as squeezed states or number states.
 These are not mathematically representable as a classical, positive, non-singul

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently, large networks employed as quantum computers have been used to
 claim quantum computational advantage through generation of specific random
 number distributions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "arute2019quantum,zhong2020quantum,Zhong2021Phase,madsenQuantumComputationalAdvantage2022"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This leads to a theoretical challenge: how does one validate the hardware?
 Are the random numbers generated correctly? Do they follow the expected
 probability distribution?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditional number-state validation methods are only practical for small
 scale networks, since they use an exponentially large basis set.
 This rules out direct calculations, due to the finite size, computational
 time and precision of a digital computer.
 Although more feasible, even Monte-Carlo methods take an exponentially
 long time digitally 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "bulmerBoundaryQuantumAdvantage2022a"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other methods utilize low order moments of the expected distribution, which
 are calculable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "villalonga2021efficient,ohSpoofingCrossEntropy2022a"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Although scalable, such methods cannot verify higher-order correlations
 generated in the network.
 Therefore, these can only validate part of a larger picture.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) with linear networks, other methods using
 quantum phase-space exist.
 These do allow comparisons of theory and experiment for large, nonclassical
 networks, simulating all measurable correlations generated by an experiment.
 A computational implementation is necessary, however.

ulations using phase-space representations - is a software package that
 does this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While xQSim is able to compare theoretical predictions with experimental
 data, it cannot generate exactly a direct random output of photon counts.
 This is the goal that experiments attempt to implement

 However, there is extensive theory suggesting that such brute-force computation
s are #P hard at large scale

literal "false"

\end_inset

, and therefore our code implements a completely different approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To do this, we employ three phase-space simulation methods: the positive
 P-distribution 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drummond_generalizedP1980"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $phase=1$
\end_inset

), the Wigner distribution 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Wigner_1932"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $phase=2$
\end_inset

), provided it has a positive distribution for the corresponding input state,
 and the Husimi Q-function 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Husimi1940"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $phase=3$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The present code distribution can simulate multidimensional photon probabilities
 using binning, as well as photon number correlations and quadrature moments
 for a variety of inputs, networks and output measurements.
 It uses sampling and binning to obtain computable results, giving errors
 comparable to the sampling errors of the experimental measurements.
 In addition to simulating Gaussian quantum inputs, admixtures of thermal
 noise can be included to model phase decoherence in the input states.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Saturating or click detectors require the use of 
\begin_inset Formula $phase=1$
\end_inset

.
 This is also preferred for intensity correlations, due to the exponentially
 lower sampling error obtained.
 Quadrature measurements are best simulated with 
\begin_inset Formula $phase=2$
\end_inset

.
 However, intensity correlation and quadrature probabilities can be simulated
 using all phase-space methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The code generates  binned moments.
 These are vital for large-scale comparisons with data, due to the exponential
 sparsity of the distributions.
 It can extract experimental moments from available public datasets, which
 depends on the available data and the encoding employed.
 In addition, it implements classical sampling methods, which are necessarily
 approximate.
 These allow comparative evaluation of experimental outputs with approximate
 classical sampling methods that generate random samples of output counts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The programs provided are written in Matlab, which is a proprietary language
 of The Mathworks Inc.
 It is fully compatible with Octave, which is a free public domain clone
 of Matlab.
 Parallel features are only available in Matlab currently, and require the
 parallel toolbox to give large speed improvements on multicore computers.
 Some code for classical count generation requires the Python language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A GPU/Python version exists 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, for GPU enabled supercomputers.
 While this does not implement all the features of the Matlab version, it
 may be faster for some calculations, with up to

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section provides a comprehensive theoretical background to the general
 theory of linear networks, including input inputs to the network, detection
 mechanisms and observable correlations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Linear photonic networks
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Linear-photonic-networks"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The numerical code solves for output observables obtained after a linear
 transformation of a multi-mode quantum input state 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\rho}^{(\text{in})}$
\end_inset

.
 The mode transformation is generated by a linear photonic network of generalize
d beam-splitters and phase delays.
 This acts as an 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

-mode interferometer such that output modes are linear combinations of each
 input mode.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without losses, the network itself is defined by an 
\begin_inset Formula $M\times M$
\end_inset

 Haar random unitary matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{U}$
\end_inset

.
 Physically, this corresponds to the interference of input photons that
 generates large amounts of entanglement due to the exponential number of
 paths available to photons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the ideal, lossless case, one has:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{a}_{i}^{(\text{out})}=\sum_{j=1}^{M}U_{ij}\hat{a}_{j}^{(\text{in})},\label{eq:linear_combo}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{a}_{i}^{(\text{in})}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{a}_{j}^{(\text{out})}$
\end_inset

 are the input and output annihilation operators for modes 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Practically, losses in the network are commonplace, thus causing the experimenta
l transmission matrix to be non-unitary.
 Therefore, lossy networks are denoted by the transmission matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Not every input channel needs to have an input.
 In these cases, 
\begin_inset Formula $N\subset M$
\end_inset

 represents the number of input modes, thus changing the unitary to an 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times M$
\end_inset

 transmission matrix.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These give a different transformation law, where:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{a}_{i}^{(\text{out})}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}T_{ij}\hat{a}_{j}^{(\text{in})}+\sum_{j=1}^{M}B_{ij}\hat{b}_{j}^{(\text{in})},\label{eq:linear_combo-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, the 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{b}_{i}^{(\text{in})}$
\end_inset

are noise operators.
 These are necessary to conserve the operator commutation relations.
 They comprise inputs from the reservoirs that cause losses, as well as
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $M-N$
\end_inset

 vacuum inputs at unused ports.
 They are independent commuting operators, whose reservoirs are all in a
 vacuum state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the need to conserve commutators, we know that for both inputs and
 outputs:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\left[\hat{a}_{i},\hat{a}_{j}\right] & =0\nonumber \\
\left[\hat{a}_{i},\hat{a}_{j}^{\dagger}\right] & =\delta_{ij}.\label{eq:bose_comm_rel}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Applying this to the outputs, considering a vacuum state input, and taking
 expectation values, gives
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\delta_{ij} & =\left\langle \left[\hat{a}_{i}^{(\text{out})},\hat{a}_{j}^{\dagger(\text{out})}\right]\right\rangle \\
 & =\left\langle \left[\sum_{k=1}^{M}\left(T_{ik}\hat{a}_{k}^{(\text{in})}+B_{ik}\hat{b}_{k}^{(\text{in})}\right),\sum_{\ell=1}^{M}\left(T_{j\ell}^{*}\hat{a}_{\ell}^{\dagger(\text{in})}+B_{j\ell}^{*}\hat{b}_{\ell}^{\dagger(\text{in})}\right)\right]\right\rangle \\
 & =\sum_{k=1}^{M}\left(T_{ik}T_{jk}^{*}+B_{ik}B_{jk}^{*}\right)=\left(\bm{T}\bm{T}^{\dagger}+\bm{B}\bm{B}^{\dagger}\right)_{ij}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\delta_{ij} & =\left\langle \left[\hat{a}_{i}^{(\text{out})},\hat{a}_{j}^{\dagger(\text{out})}\right]\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & =\sum_{k}\left(T_{ik}T_{jk}^{*}+B_{ik}B_{jk}^{*}\right).
\end{align}

\end_inset

Next, we can define a new 
\begin_inset Formula $M\times M$
\end_inset

 matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\bm{D}=\bm{B}\bm{B}^{\dagger}=\bm{I}-\bm{T}\bm{T}^{\dagger}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is hermitian, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{D}^{\dagger}=\bm{D}$
\end_inset

, and so has a diagonal representation as 
\begin_inset Formula $D=\tilde{U}\lambda^{2}\tilde{U}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

, for some unitary matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{U}$
\end_inset

.
 We assume that the transmission matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{T}$
\end_inset

 is lossy, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{D}$
\end_inset

 is positive definite and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is real, representing absorption rather than gain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Quantum input states
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Quantum-input-states"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input state is defined in a number of ways depending on the desired
 distribution one wishes to sample from.
 If each input mode is independent, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\rho}^{(\text{in})}$
\end_inset

 is a product of input states.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To sample from the permanent, inputs are single photon Fock states such
 that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}^{(\text{in})}=\prod_{j=1}^{M}\left|1\right\rangle _{j}\left\langle 1\right|_{j},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|1\right\rangle _{j}=a_{j}^{\dagger}\left|0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To sample from the Hafnian or Torontonian, the input is a product of single-mode
 pure squeezed vacuum states 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}^{(\text{in})}=\prod_{j=1}^{M}\left|r_{j}\right\rangle \left\langle r_{j}\right|,
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{r}=[r_{1},\dots,r_{M}]$
\end_inset

 is the squeezing vector and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\left|r_{j}\right\rangle  & =\hat{S}(r_{j})\left|0\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & =\exp\left(r_{j}\frac{(a_{j}^{\dagger})^{2}}{2}-r_{j}\frac{\hat{a}_{j}^{2}}{2}\right)\left|0\right\rangle ,\label{eq:squeezed_state_exp}
\end{align}

\end_inset

is the squeezed vacuum state where we have assumed the squeezed phase is
 zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, xQSim can only generate input squeezed states and thermal states
 as outlined below.
 Other inputs are possible, since the positive P-representation and Q-representa
tion are complete, positive representations, and can be added through user
 customization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pure squeezed states
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a single-mode, squeezed vacuum states are generated by applying the
 squeezing operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}(r)$
\end_inset

 onto a vacuum state.
 As is clear from the operator definition Eq.(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:squeezed_state_exp"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), where we drop the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 subscript for the single-mode case, squeezed vacuum states always generate
 even numbers of photons.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mean photon number 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{n}=\left\langle \hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and coherence 
\begin_inset Formula $m=\left\langle \left(\hat{a}\right)^{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 can be derived using the relations 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\hat{S}^{\dagger}(r)\hat{a}\hat{S}(r) & =\hat{a}\cosh(r)-\hat{a}^{\dagger}\sinh(r)\nonumber \\
\hat{S}^{\dagger}(r)\hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{S}(r) & =\hat{a}^{\dagger}\cosh(r)-\hat{a}\sinh(r),
\end{align}

\end_inset

where the mean photon number is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\bar{n} & =\left\langle \hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & =\left\langle r\right|\hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}\left|r\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & =\left\langle 0\right|\hat{S}^{\dagger}(r)\hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}\hat{S}(r)\left|0\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & =\sinh^{2}(r),
\end{align}

\end_inset

whilst the coherence is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
m & =\left\langle \left(\hat{a}\right)^{2}\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & =\left\langle r\right|\hat{a}\hat{a}\left|r\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & =\left\langle 0\right|\hat{S}^{\dagger}(r)\hat{a}\hat{a}\hat{S}(r)\left|0\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 & =\sinh(r)\cosh(r).
\end{align}

\end_inset

 For pure squeezed states, the coherence and photon number are related via
 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{2}-\bar{n}=\bar{n}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The superposition of only even Fock states becomes clearer when expanding
 the squeezed state in terms of Fock states as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left|r\right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{\cosh(r)}}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\sqrt{(2n)!}}{2^{n}n!}\tanh^{n}(r)\left|2n\right\rangle ,\label{eq:Fock state_exp}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $n=0,1,2,\dots$
\end_inset

 is the number of photons.
 From the above Fock state expansion the photon number distribution for
 the squeezed vacuum state is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
P_{2n} & =\frac{1}{\cosh(r)}\frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^{2n}2^{2n}}(\tanh(r))^{2n},\nonumber \\
P_{2n+1} & =0,
\end{align}

\end_inset

with variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{n}^{2}=2\bar{n}(\bar{n}+1)=\bar{n}(1+\cosh(2r_{j}))$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Squeezed states are minimum uncertainty states and are therefore defined
 entirely by their quadrature variances.
 Using the quadrature operators

\end_inset

which obey the commutation relation

\end_inset

, the normally ordered 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

All the results derived here are also valid for multiple modes, denoted
 by the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, given each mode is independent as is the case in optical networks.
 Currently, xQSim can simulate pure and thermalized squeezed states as well
 as classical thermal state inputs into the network.
 This is achieved using a model for thermal squeezed states which alters
 the multi-mode input coherence 
\begin_inset Formula $m(r_{j})$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{m}(r_{j})=(1-\epsilon)m(r_{j})$
\end_inset

 whilst keeping the input photon number 
\begin_inset Formula $n(r_{j})=\bar{n}_{j}$

 unchanged.
 This allows users to easily interpolate between thermal,

Thermal states are classical states with fluctuations larger than the vacuum

\end_inset

In the thermalized case, the relationship between coherence and photon number
 is modified, since to eliminate 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 one must use the relationship that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\tilde{m}^{2}}{\left(2n_{th}+1\right)^{2}} & =\sinh^{2}\left(r\right)\left(1+\sinh^{2}\left(r\right)\right)\\

\end_inset

Therefore:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\tilde{m}^{2} & =\left(\bar{n}-n_{th}\right)\left(1+\bar{n}+n_{th}\right)\nonumber \\

Photonic networks employed as quantum computers aim to sample from an output

 Which output probability is sampled depends on the input states to the

The sampled distribution not only depends on the input state but also the
 detector type.
 When photon-number resolving (PNR) detectors are used one samples either

 The Torontonian corresponds to the use of saturating, or click, detectors

\begin_layout Standard
Each grouped count is obtained by summing over photon count patterns

 Therefore, grouped counts contain

 In one-dimension, GCPs are the probability of observing

 The modes in each subset are denoted in the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{S}$

The implied segregation of output modes in the two-dimensional example above

\begin_inset Formula $S_{2}$

 the next

 However, there is no practical restriction on the output modes each subset

\begin_layout Standard
For example, when

\boldsymbol{S} & =(S_{1},S_{2})=(\{1,4\},\{2,3\}).
\end{align}

Each permutation generates a different correlation, where we assume the
 commutation of GCP probabilities with subsets 
\begin_inset Formula $(\{1,3\},\{2,4\})=(\{2,4\},\{1,3\})$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This permutation only changes the multidimensional GCP simulations, as in
 the total count case all modes are contained in the same subset 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\{1,\dots,M\}$

 This is also the case when simulating marginal probabilities, which are
 obtained by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $n<M$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $M-n$

 inputs are ignored.
 The first-order marginal, 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$

\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \hat{\pi}_{j}(1)\right\rangle $

\begin_layout Standard
The outputs in phase-space are continuous real or complex variables whose

 This assumes that the parameters are precisely known, and do not have noise

\begin_layout Standard
However, the diagonal P-representation famously breaks down for certain

doubles the classical phase-space dimension, allowing off-diagonal amplitudes

\begin_layout Standard
One can restrict the distribution to a classical phase-space with

 However, for squeezed states, this will lead to the singular behavior that

 The matrix-P representation is then defined relative to a complete set

The measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{d}\vec{\lambda}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the Wigner function always exists as a real-valued function on
 phase-space for the density operator, or any other hermitian operator,
 the resulting probability distribution need not be positive.
 This is why the Wigner distribution is referred to as a quasi-probability.
 However for thermal and squeezed states, the Wigner distribution is positive.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the positive distribution, the Wigner function is only valid for
 symmetrically ordered operator products.
 Symmetric ordering, denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\dots\}_{sym}$

 operators, for example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\{\hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}^{2}\}_{sym} & =\frac{1}{3}(\hat{a}^{2}\hat{a}^{\dagger}+\hat{a}\hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}+\hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}^{2}).
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This ordering requirement makes applications to normally ordered detectors
 both cumbersome, as one must reorder all operators to normal order, and
 inaccurate, as seen from Eq.(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\langle \{\hat{a}^{\dagger}a\}_{sym}\right\rangle =|\alpha|^{2}+\frac{1}{2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Therefore, the Wigner function adds half a quantum of vacuum noise per mode
 causing a rapid increase sampling errors, making the Wigner function unsuitable
 for simulations of network output probabilities.

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \dots\right\rangle _{Q}$

 denotes a Q-distribution average.
 
\end_layout

However, like the Wigner function, operators must be reordered for applications

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

The Q-function adds a quantum of vacuum noise per mode, generating the largest

Alternatively, one can use xQSim to estimate probability densities of observable

 This is achived by binning coherent amplitudes of

 equispaced bins with spacing

 within the range 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{j}\pm\Delta_{b}/2$

 The probability densitiy is then estimated as

\begin_layout Standard
The section outlines the numerical methods and statistical tests implemented
 by xQSim to simulate linear network output distributions and perform comparison
s with either experimental data, or exact tests.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Input-output samples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To simulate linear networks in phase-space, one must first generate initial
 stochastic samples.
 This is achieved using the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

-ordering scheme as stochastic samples for any Gaussian input state in any
 representation are generated following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\alpha_{j} & =\frac{1}{2}\left(\Delta_{\sigma x_{j}}w_{j}+i\Delta_{\sigma y_{j}}w_{j+M}\right)\nonumber \\
\beta_{j} & =\frac{1}{2}\left(\Delta_{\sigma x_{j}}w_{j}-i\Delta_{\sigma y_{j}}w_{j+M}\right),
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle w_{j}w_{k}\right\rangle =\delta_{jk}$
\end_inset

 are real Gaussian noises and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\Delta_{\sigma x_{j}}^{2} & =2(n_{j}+\sigma+\tilde{m}_{j})\nonumber \\
\Delta_{\sigma y_{j}}^{2} & =2(n_{j}+\sigma-\tilde{m}_{j}),\label{eq:quad_var_altered}
\end{align}

\end_inset

are thermal squeezed state quadrature variances which are altered from the
 pure squeezed state definitions Eqs.(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:x-quad"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:y-quad"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For normally ordering, the input amplitudes 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\alpha},\boldsymbol{\beta}$
\end_inset

 are converted to outputs as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\alpha}' & =\boldsymbol{T\alpha}\nonumber \\
\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\beta}}' & =\boldsymbol{T}^{*}\boldsymbol{\beta},
\end{align}

\end_inset

which follows from Eq.(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:linear_combo"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 However for non-normally ordered methods, additional vacuum noise arising
 from the reservoir modes must be included.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is achieved using a hermitian decoherence matrix 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{D}=\boldsymbol{I}-\boldsymbol{T}^{\dagger}\boldsymbol{T},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with decomposition 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{D}=\boldsymbol{U}\boldsymbol{\lambda}^{2}\boldsymbol{U}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{B}=\boldsymbol{U}\boldsymbol{\lambda}\boldsymbol{U}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 is the matrix square root and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 is a diagonal, positive matrix.
 The output amplitudes when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma>0$
\end_inset

 are then obtained as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\alpha}'=\boldsymbol{T\alpha}+\sqrt{\frac{\sigma}{2}}\boldsymbol{B}(\boldsymbol{u}+i\boldsymbol{v}),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\beta}'=\boldsymbol{\alpha}^{\prime*}$
\end_inset

, since we are in a classical phase-space.

Threshold detectors

GCPs are readily simulated in phase-space using the positive-P representation
 by replacing the normally ordered projection operator Eq.(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:click proj"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) with the positive-P observable 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\pi_{i}(c_{i})=:e^{-n'_{i}}\left(e^{n'_{i}}-1\right)^{c_{i}},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $n'_{i}=\alpha'_{i}\beta'_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the output photon number.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The summation over exponentially many patterns implemented by GCPs (see
 Eq.(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:GCP"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) is simulated using a multidimensional inverse discrete Fourier transform
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\tilde{\mathcal{G}}_{\boldsymbol{S}}^{(n)}(\boldsymbol{k}) & =\left\langle \prod_{j=1}^{d}\bigotimes_{i\in S_{j}}\left(\pi_{i}(0)+\pi_{i}(1)e^{-ik_{j}\theta_{j}}\right)\right\rangle _{P},\nonumber \\
\mathcal{G}_{\boldsymbol{S}}^{(n)}(\boldsymbol{m}) & =\frac{1}{\prod_{j}(M_{j}+1)}\sum_{\boldsymbol{k}}\tilde{\mathcal{G}}_{\boldsymbol{S}}^{(n)}(\boldsymbol{k})e^{i\sum k_{j}\theta_{j}m_{j}},
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{j}=2\pi/(M_{j}+1)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{j}=0,\dots,M_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Fourier transform removes all patterns which don't contain 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{m}$
\end_inset

 counts, in doing this the Fourier transform simulates all possible correlations
 generated in a network.
 This reduces an otherwise computationally complex task into a highly efficient
 and scalable one, allowing comparisons to be performed on experimental
 correlations of any order.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
PNR detectors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To simulate GCPs of PNR detectors, we are interested in the total number
 of output photons contained in each subset 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{j}$
\end_inset

 defined in operator form 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{n}'_{S_{j}}=\sum_{i\in S_{j}}\hat{n}'_{i}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

As was the case for threshold detectors, we replace this total number operator
 with the phase-space observable 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
n'_{S_{j}}=\sum_{i\in S_{j}}n'_{i},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

such that the actual GCP computation is performed as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{G}_{\boldsymbol{S}}^{(n)}(\boldsymbol{m})=\iint P(\boldsymbol{\alpha},\boldsymbol{\beta})\left[\prod_{j=1}^{d}\left[\frac{1}{m_{j}!}:(n'_{S_{j}})^{m_{j}}e^{-n'_{S_{j}}}:\right]\right]\text{d}^{2}\bm{\alpha}\text{d}^{2}\boldsymbol{\beta}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note that this method allows one to avoid the multi-dimensional Fourier
 transform needed for the threshold detector distribution.
 The Fourier transform has the effect of introducing Fourier overheads which
 can slow down simulations of multi-dimensional distributions, especially
 for dimensions 
\begin_inset Formula $d\ge4$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Statistical tests 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data generated and compared with experiment is in the form of probabilities
 of clicks or binned click patterns.
 xQSim implements two statistical tests: chi-square and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

-statistic tests.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Chi-square tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 observations in a random sample from a population are classified into classes
 with observed numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 (for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2,…,k$
\end_inset

), and a null hypothesis gives the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 that an observation falls into the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th class, then the expected numbers are 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{i}=np_{i}$
\end_inset

 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The limiting distribution of the quantity given below is the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 distribution:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\chi^{2} & =\sum_{i=1}^{k}\frac{(x_{i}-m_{i})^{2}}{m_{i}}\\
 & =\sum_{i=1}^{k}\frac{(x_{i}/n-p_{i})^{2}}{p_{i}/n}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 For our purposes, define an experimental probability estimate as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}^{e}=x_{i}/n$
\end_inset

, then
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\chi^{2} & =\sum_{i=1}^{k}\frac{(p_{i}^{e}-p_{i})^{2}}{\sigma_{i}^{2}}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}^{2}=p_{i}/n$
\end_inset

, is the estimated experimental variance.
 This is only valid for click detectors, or PNR detectors when photon flux
 is small, as binary outputs can be modeled as Poissonian.
 For larger photon numbers this is not the case as multiple photons can
 be detected simultaneously.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typically, counts less that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}^{min}\sim10$
\end_inset

 are ignored, as the distribution is no longer Gaussian for small counts.
 The program produces 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 tests that include an estimate of simulation errors:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma_{i}^{2}=p_{i}/n+\sigma_{i}^{s2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this can also be used to compare simulations with other analytic
 comparison theories, not just with experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Z-statistic tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

-statistic, or 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

-score, test determines how many standard deviations a test statistic, 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, is from its expected, normally distributed mean and is defined as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 are the mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution, respectively.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $k\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, the chi-square distribution of the test statistic approaches a normal
 distribution via the central limit theorem.
 Typically this convergence is slow, however using the Wilson-Hilferty (WH)
 transformation, an accurate convergence can be achieved when 
\begin_inset Formula $k\geq10$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the WH transformed chi-square statistic 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\chi^{2}/k\right)^{1/3}$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

-statistic of the chi-square distribution is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=\frac{\left(\chi^{2}/k\right)^{1/3}-(1-2/(9k))}{\sqrt{2/(9k)}},
\]

\end_inset

for comparisons with 
\begin_inset Formula $k\geq10$
\end_inset

 distinct classes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

-statistic is used to determine the randomness of output patterns, as large
 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 values could indicate experimental output patterns are not occurring randomly.
 A threshold of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z>6$
\end_inset

 is used to define outputs with extremely small probabilities of occurring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

-statistic becomes particularly powerful when used in conjunction with random
 permutations of output patterns, as repeatedly observing large 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 values indicates outputs with very small probabilities are being continuously
 observed.
 This could indicate systematic errors in an experimental network are causing
 non-random behavior, such as more 
\begin_inset Formula $0's$
\end_inset

 than 
\begin_inset Formula $1's$
\end_inset

 in binary patterns, to occur.

 There are also test scripts with inputs that can be modified.
 The functions used can be replaced as required for different applications.
 The input is a sequence of parameter structures in a cell array.
 The output data is a nested cell array giving first the sequence index,
 then one graph index for each average correlation calculated.

The output data is compatible with the xGraph multidimensional batch graphics
 program, documented separately.
 Other graphics codes can be used, too, if compatible with the data files.
 An example and description of the basic functions available is given below.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Optimizing decoherence & transmission
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using xQSim to compare theoretical and experimental quantum networks,
 it is recommended that the first simulation use 
\begin_inset Formula $thermal=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $tr=1$
\end_inset

.
 This corresponds to pure squeezed state inputs (see subsection.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Quantum-input-states"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) whilst 
\begin_inset Formula $tr$
\end_inset

 corrects measurement errors in the transmission matrix.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once completed, users may wish to simulate decoherence effects.
 Although exact values are up to users discretion, it is recommended to
 use Matlab's 
\shape italic
fminsearch
\shape default
 function to find optimal fitting values.
 These correspond to the lowest obtainable 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 output.
 An example of how to implement 
\shape italic
fminsearch
\shape default
 in xQSim is given below for the script 
\shape italic
xQSim_165W_experiment.m

 contained in the folder

This will run xQSim multiple times for different parameters until it reaches
 a minimum at which point it will output the optimal values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some general considerations when using 
\shape italic
fminsearch
\shape default
 is that it may take multiple hours to complete, assuming the user has access
 to Matlab's parallel computing toolbox.
 Without the parallel toolbox computation time will increase significantly.
 If this is the case, a manual optimizing route may be more efficient.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reduce computation time, 
\shape italic
fminsearch
\shape default
 can be stopped before it has found the absolute minimum.
 This is due to two reasons:

Since xQSim simulates stochastic samples, output probabilities will vary
 slightly between runs causing

 output differences between simulation runs becomes negligible once

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $tr$
\end_inset

 are accurate to 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx4/5$
\end_inset

 decimal places.
 Since 
\shape italic
fminsearch

 will continue repeating simulations until a minimum is found, the increase
 in computation for greater decimal accuracy may outweigh the negligible
 improvement in 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
If the user wishes to have the option of stopping 
\shape italic
fminsearch
\shape default
 early, it is recommended to use the parameter 
\shape italic
p.deco
\shape default
.
 
\shape italic
fminsearch
\shape default
 doesn't output the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $eps$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 it uses in each simulation run, only outputting them once it's fully completed.
 Therefore, 
\shape italic
p.deco
\shape default
 prints the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $eps$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 before each simulation run, allowing the user to know what decoherence
 factors the most recent simulation run has used.

 be sure to either comment out or remove the graphics program

 These comparison plots are not necessary when optimizing decoherence and

\shape default
: Extracts data from binary files with big endian encoding.
 Corresponds to experiment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Algorithm is run separately from the input m-file simulation script and
 is only valid when

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\shape italic
qcountsbe
\shape default
: Extracts data from the same binary encoding as 
\shape italic
qcounts
\shape default
 but is integrated into the input m-file and is valid for any mode number.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\shape italic
qcountsle
\shape default
: Extracts data from binary files with little endian encoding.
 Corresponds to experiment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Like

 and is integrated into the input m-file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example implementation of 
\shape italic
qcountsle
\shape default
 is supplied below.
 To allow phase-space simulations to be performed immediately after extraction,
 the experimental counts integer 
\shape italic
Count
\shape default
 is output.
 When using 
\shape italic
qcountsbe
\shape default
 or 
\shape italic
qcountsle
\shape default
, the integer variable 
\shape italic
bits
\shape default
 is required to input the bit-type of the encoded data file.
 Although 
\shape italic
qcountsbe
\shape default

\shape italic
qcountsle
\shape default
 have been generalized, this is limited to data from experiments 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 since every experiment may encode data differently.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only time user's may wish to extract additional data is to perform random
 permutation tests, which require permutations to be applied before binning.
 In this case, one can use 
\shape italic
qcounts_permute
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
qcountsle_permute
\shape default
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $100$
\end_inset

-mode and 
\begin_inset Formula $144$
\end_inset

-mode data, respectively.
 The only addition in these scripts compared to the standard extraction
 code is the use of Matlab's 
\shape italic
randperm
\shape default
 function.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times M$
\end_inset

 random permutation vector applied to each pattern is then saved as 
\shape italic
randp.mat
\shape default
, which is called from the main Matlab directory using the function 
\shape italic
xqpermutation
\shape default
 and set as the par mater 
\shape italic
p.permute
\shape default
.
 This permutation vector is then applied to the rows of the transmission
 matrix for use in phase-space simulations.

xQSim inputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When xQSim is used, it is called with the argument (input).
 Each simulation is defined as a cell array of structures:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
input:=\{p_{1},p_{2},\ldots\}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each structure 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 contains parameters relevant to a particular step in the sequence:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p:=(p.modes,\ldots)
\]

\end_inset

If the sequence has just one member, a structure can be used directly, without
 an enclosing cell array.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
xQSim internal phase-space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although this is transparent to the user, each network in the sequence transform
s a matrix of quantum phase-space amplitudes: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bm{a}:=\left[\bm{\alpha},(\bm{\beta},\bm{\gamma})\right]_{j}=a_{ij}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first index is the mode index, from 
\begin_inset Formula $1,\ldots,M$
\end_inset

, where indices from 
\begin_inset Formula $1,\ldots,M$
\end_inset

 indicate amplitudes equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{a}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 These are needed in all cases.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $phase=1$
\end_inset

 additional indices from 
\begin_inset Formula $M+1,\ldots,2M$
\end_inset

 are amplitudes equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{a}_{i}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

, which are not required for a classical phase-space as in the W or Q representa
tions.
 The third output, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{\gamma}$
\end_inset

, indexed from 
\begin_inset Formula $2M+1,\ldots,3M$
\end_inset

 contains the input photon number, which is used for the matrix-P representation.
 These quantum amplitudes can be recycled in a sequence of network operations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second index is from 
\begin_inset Formula $1,\dots,p.ensembles(1)$
\end_inset

, for ensemble averaging using vector parallel processing.
 These transformations are repeated 
\begin_inset Formula $p.ensembles(2)$
\end_inset

 times in a local loop, and 
\begin_inset Formula $p.ensembles(3)$
\end_inset

 times nonlocally, with parallel loops.
 At least one loop ensemble larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 is required to estimate errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
User's can vary between phase-space representations using 
\begin_inset Formula $phase$
\end_inset

 which corresponds to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

-ordering notation via 
\begin_inset Formula $phase=1$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=0$
\end_inset

, ie, a P-representation; 
\begin_inset Formula $phase=2$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=1/2$
\end_inset

, ie, a Wigner representation; and 
\begin_inset Formula $phase=3$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=1$
\end_inset

, ie, a Husimi Q representation.

xQSim outputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The output data is a nested cell array, whose length is the total sequence
 length:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
data:=\{d_{1},d_{2},\ldots\}
\]

\end_inset

At each step in the sequence, a data cell array 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 of individual quantum expectation values or graphs is generated, where:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d:=\{g_{1},g_{2},\ldots\}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here each graph 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the output of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-th defined observe function, described below.
 These are real, multidimensional arrays of the data.
 They include averages calculated by the observe functions, and error-bars
 generated by the 
\begin_inset Formula $qsim$
\end_inset

 code:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g:=\left(g_{\ell j_{1}j_{2}\ldots j_{n},e}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a standardized form of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 The first index 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 is a line index, reserved for subsequent plotting software.
 The next 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 indices are a multidimensional data array with arbitrary dimensionality.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $cyc>1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{1}$
\end_inset

 is the cycle index.
 Other dimensions may correspond to a mode index or to a count number.
 The last index 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 is an error index, to address the data and sampling error.
 This is also used to index the comparison or experimental data, if it is
 available from the optional compare functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
xGraph inputs 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If xGraph is used, it is called with the arguments (input, data).
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $input$
\end_inset

 is a cell array, a sequence of graphics structures.
 It can be the same cell array used to define the simulation parameters.
 However, the graphics parameters are a distinct set.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $data$
\end_inset

 is the output data from xQSim, or some combination of the output data in
 more complex examples.
 One can run xQSim multiple times with different parameters to show functional
 dependences.
 The purpose of xGraph is to allow batch generation of many graphs from
 a multidimensional data array.

\begin_layout Subsection
Observations 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The observe functions are user-specified functions that calculate an observable
 average and return it, given the phase-space amplitude matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\bm{a}$
\end_inset

.
 Each observe function can have arbitrary output dimensionality.
 Each can be assigned its own graphics parameters, and an optional initialize
 function that initializes a given graph, specified by the graph number
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 Parameters are passed to the observe functions through the parameter structure,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 Observe functions are passed as handles, in a cell array, as @x2 (etc).

Comparisons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The compare function is a user-specified function that evaluates a function
 and returns it.
 This is used for testing and also to input experimental data for comparisons.
 The comparisons may include error data, which can be zero for exact results.
 Comparisons are also plotted using compare.
 This generates additional comparison plots, as well as error totals that
 are converted into a 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

- error estimate when there are statistical variances available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all analytic comparisons, there are two options:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
an identity transmission matrix can be used with an arbitrary Gaussian input,
 uniform or non-uniform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
any unitary with a scaled transmission (
\begin_inset Formula $t\le1$
\end_inset

) can be used with a fully thermalized (
\begin_inset Formula $p.thermal=1$
\end_inset

), uniform input.

Arbitrary dimensions are possible, although these are typically constrained
 by memory, due to a required increase in the number of samples, as well
 as the requirements to store the multi-dimensional MATLAB array.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of figures produced by the graphical visualization function

 varies depends on the binning dimension.
 For a single dimension, a simple two dimensional plot with the binning
 range on the horizontal axis, and the density estimate on the vertical
 axis is produced.
 For two or higher dimensions, a surface plot of the multivariate distribution
 is produced with the binning ranges along the two horizontal axes, and
 the multi-variate distribuion along the vertical, as well a a two dimensional
 planar slice through the midpoint of the surface

\begin_layout Standard
This is generated by the Matlab program qcounts.m, which analyses experimental
 count data, from binary files in *.bin.
 It generates individual Matlab data files for each observable and records
 the total number of valid counts, which are also saved in the data files.
 All experimental data should be on the Matlab path if comparisons are required.

\begin_layout Standard
Using the compare function, experimental data is called from user specified
 functions which also sets error data to zero.
 Experimental error data is then calculated in xQSim and, following the
 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

-squared theory below, is converted into a 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

-squared error estimate.
 Experimental comparison functions are located in qDATA.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 for the comparison functions, special multimode test cases are used, in
 which all output events are independent.
 This is obtainable either from having arbitrary independent thermalized
 squeezed inputs and a diagonal transmission matrix, or else by having a
 uniform, fully thermalized input together with an arbitrary unitary transmissio
n matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Either of these cases lead to independent outputs in which each mode is
 in a Gaussian state.
 The simplest case is for a uniform output in which 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \hat{\pi}\left(1\right)\right\rangle =p$
\end_inset

 is constant.
 In this case, the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 total clicks in 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 channels has a probability of:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P\left(m\right)=\frac{M!p^{m}\left(1-p\right)^{M-m}}{m!\left(M-m\right)!}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Two examples of this are given below.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This example generates total count probabilities for the case of pure squeezed
 state inputs with uniform squeezing 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{r}=[1,\dots,1]$

 The transmission matrix is an 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times M$
\end_inset

 identity matrix with 
\begin_inset Formula $M=N=20$
\end_inset

 and a transmission coefficient of 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0.5$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 statistical test outputs give 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}/k\approx1\pm0.3$
\end_inset

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

-statistic gives 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\approx1\pm2$
\end_inset

.
 This indicates that the statistical test is satisfied.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Example: Intensity correlation moments versus correlation order.
 Simulations are denoted by the solid line and use the positive-P (top),
 Wigner (middle) and Q (bottom) representations whilst the dashed lines
 denotes exactly computed correlation moments.
 While the normally ordered positive-P probabilities agree with the exact
 calculations, the Wigner and Q representations deviate significantly from
 exact calculations which increase with correlation order.
 This deviation is due to vacuum fluctuations causing sampling errors increasing
 with correlation order.

High-order correlations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This example generates comparisons of click correlation moments of first
 and second order which are defined as 
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle \hat{\pi}_{j}(1)\right\rangle 
\]

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle \hat{\pi}_{j}(1)\hat{\pi}_{k}(1)\right\rangle .
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparisons can be obtained for all possible combinations of output modes,
 which follows the binomial coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{M}{n}$
\end_inset

, or for a subset of these combinations.
 The subset comparisons are preferable for graphing, whilst the full comparison
 of output modes is preferable for statistical tests to ensure all possible
 correlations are observed.
 Not observing all correlations will alter the statistical test outputs
 as there are fewer valid bins.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inputs are thermalized squeezed states with decoherence coefficient

Random permutations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This example generates comparisons of two-dimensional GCPs for binary patterns
 that have been randomly permuted.
 Inputs are thermalized squeezed states with decoherence coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $eps=0.0932$
\end_inset

 and transmission 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1.0235$
\end_inset

.
 Data for three random permutations from this experiment are available in
 the folder 
\shape italic
xQSimGBSExperiments
\shape default
, however more can be readily obtained.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Permutations are input through the parameter 
\shape italic
p.permute
\shape default
, which is assumed to be a 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times M$
\end_inset

 row vector, and are applied to the transmission matrix, changing the row
 order according to the mode ordering of the permutation.
 User's can either manually permute output modes, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p.permute=[15,8,44,\dots]$
\end_inset

, or use permutations generated from data extraction algorithms which are
 loaded from relevant .mat files by the function 
\shape italic
xqpermutation
\shape default
 (see subsection.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Data-extraction"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Note, manual permutation vectors are only applied to the transmission matrix
 rows, not the binary data which must be permuted before being binned.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulations can then be performed, with total count and click correlations
 unaffected by the permutation.
 Since each permutation produces comparisons of different correlations,
 each test will output different 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

-statistic results as well as normalized difference graphs.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
xQSim function call
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simulation function takes an input of parameter structures that define
 a sequence of networks.
 Each network in the sequence can be repeated, with recycling of the amplitudes,
 which are then combined with new squeezed or coherent inputs.
 Any input parameters or functions that are omitted are given appropriate
 default values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulations carried out by the code are performed by other specialized internal
 functions.
 Input parameters come from an 
\series bold
input
\series default
 cell array of structures, while output is saved in a 
\series bold
data
\series default
 array, and optionally in a file.
 During the simulation, global averages and error-bars are calculated for
 sampling errors.
 When completed, timing and errors are printed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The xQSim function call syntax is: [error,data,output] = xQSim(input);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input data includes parameters and methods, but with an open architecture
 for extensibility.
 Most functions are modular and replaceable.
 This is as easy as defining a new function handle to replace the default
 value.
 The code folder includes examples of how these are written.
 All output observables are divided up into a cell array of data graphs,
 generated in parallel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explain this in full detail, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Simulation parameters are stored in the 
\series bold
input
\series default
 cell array.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This describes a sequence of parameter structures, so that 
\series bold
input={p1,p2,...}
\series default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each structure 
\series bold
p1,p2,...

\series default
 generates an output which is the input of the next.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The main simulation function is called using 
\series bold
xQSim(input).

\series default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The errors and integration time are returned in the 
\series bold
error 
\series default
vector 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Averages are recorded sequentially in the 
\series bold
data
\series default
 cell array.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Parameters including defaults are returned in the 
\series bold
output
\series default
 cell array.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sequence input defines a sequence of individual simulations, with parameters
 that specify the simulation functions and give the equations and observables.
 If there is only one simulation, just one data structure is needed, without
 a cell array.
 In addition, xQSim can generates graphs with a companion graphics program,
 xGraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Parameters and functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The xQSim input objects include parameters and functions.
 Many xQSim functions are modular and replaceable, through defining a new
 function handle to replace the default value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are standard conventions used throughout: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All arguments in square brackets are optional, but may be needed only in
 specific cases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The last argument, p, is the parameter structure.

 arguments are:

\begin_layout Subsection
Hints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When using xqsim, it is a good idea to first run the batch test script,
 xqsimtest.m.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
xqsimtest.m tests your parallel toolbox installation.
 If you have no license for this, omit the third ensemble setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To create a script, it is often easiest to start with an existing script
 with similar requirements: see Examples folder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Graphics parameters can also be included in the parameter structure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{p}$
\end_inset

, either before or after calling 
\begin_inset Formula $xqsim$
\end_inset

, to modify graphs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Comparison functions can be included to compare with analytic or experimental
 results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A full list of functionality is listed below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input data, here labeled 
\begin_inset Formula $input$
\end_inset

, is a sequence of parameter structures that are labeled 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 All of the input parameters and data are later passed to the 
\begin_inset Formula $xgraph$
\end_inset

 function.
 The input data can be numbers, vectors, strings, functions and cell arrays.
 These are lists of data enclosed in curly brackets, 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\}$
\end_inset

.
 All xqsim metadata has preferred values, so only changes from the preferences
 need to be input.
 The resulting combined input including preferred values, is stored internally
 as a sequence of structures in a cell array to describe the simulation
 sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulation metadata, including all preferred default values that were used
 in a particular simulation, is also stored in the xqsim output files.
 This is done in the Matlab 
\begin_inset Formula $.mat$
\end_inset

 format, for simplicity so the entire simulation can be easily reconstructed
 or changed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some conventions are used to simplify inputs, as follows: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Most input data has default values
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Vector inputs of numbers are enclosed in square brackets, [...].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Where multiple inputs of strings, functions or vectors are needed they should
 be enclosed in curly brackets, {...}, to create a cell array.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Vector or cell array inputs with only one member don't require brackets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Incomplete vector or array inputs are completed with the last default or
 input value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Default parameters are checked by inspecting the outputs, or setting verbose
 = 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the output data arrays, the last index has 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{e}=1$
\end_inset

 for the averages.
 The first error field, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{e}=2$
\end_inset

, is reserved for any systematic errors like step-sizes.
 The last error field, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{e}=3$
\end_inset

 is used for storing one standard deviation error-bar estimates due to computati
onal sampling errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Parameter table
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sec:Simulation-parameters"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulation parameters are stored in a parameter structure which is passed
 to the 
\begin_inset Formula $xsim$
\end_inset

 program.
 Inputs have default values, which are user-modifiable through the xpreferences
 function.
 Defaults can be checked by including the input 
\begin_inset Formula $verbose=2$
\end_inset

.
 All the inputs are part of a structure passed to xQSim.
 If a cell array of multiple structures are input, these are executed in
 sequence, with the output of the first simulation passed to the second,
 then the third, and so on.

\begin_layout Section
xGraph reference
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:xGRAPH-reference"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graphics function provided is a general purpose multidimensional batch
 graphics code, xGraph, which can be called when xQSim is finished.
 The results are graphed and output if required.
 Alternatively, xGraph can be replaced by another graphics code, or it can
 be used to process the data generated by xQSim at a later time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The program is described elsewhere, but the documentation is replicated
 here for users who wish to use it.
 The xGraph function call syntax is: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
xgraph (data [,input])
\series default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This takes simulation data and input cell arrays with graphics parameters,
 then plots graphs.
 The data should have as many cells as there are input cells, for sequences.
 The data can include comparisons, either analytic or experimental, and
 error-bars for both the simulations and the comparisons, since either may
 have sampling or other errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If data = 'filename.h5' or 'filename.mat', the specified file is read both
 for input and data.
 Here .h5 indicates an HDF5 file, and .mat indicates a Matlab file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the data input is a filename, parameters in the file can be replaced
 by new input parameters that are specified.
 Any stored input parameters in the file are overwritten when graphs are
 generated.
 This allows graphs of data to be modified retrospectively, if the simulation
 takes too long to be run again in a reasonable timeframe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Parameter and data structures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a batch graphics function, intended to process quantities of graphics
 data in sequence, input as a cell array of multi-dimensional data.
 Theoretical and/or experimental data is passed to the graphics program,
 including the complete data cell array and a cell array of graphics parameters
 for plotting each graph.
 For a sequence of one member, the enclosing cell array can be omitted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To explain xGraph in full detail, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Data to be graphed are recorded sequentially in a cell array, with data={d1,d2,...}.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Graphics parameters including defaults are given in the input cell array.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This describes a sequence of graph parameters, so that input={p1,p2,...}.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For a one member sequence, a dataset and parameter structure can be used
 on its own.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each dataset and parameter structure describes a set of graphs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data input to xGraph can either come from a file, or from data generated
 directly with xQSim.
 The main graphics data is a nested cell array.
 It contains several numerical graphics arrays.
 Each defines one independent set of averaged data, the observed data averages,
 stored in a cell array indexed as 
\begin_inset Formula $data\{s\}\{n\}(\ell,\mathbf{j},c)$
\end_inset

.
 To graph these also requires a corresponding cell array of structures of
 graphics parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The output is unlimited, apart from memory limits.
 The program also generates error comparisons and chi-squared values if
 required.
 The data structure for input is as follows: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The input is a cell array of parameter structures, which can be collapsed
 to one structure 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The input data is a cell array of datasets, which can be collapsed to a
 single dataset 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each dataset is a cell array of multidimensional graphs, with arbitrary
 dimensionality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The first or line index of each graph array allows multiple lines, with
 different line-styles 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The last or check index of each graph array is optionally used for error
 and comparison fields.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each graph array can generate multiple graphic plots, as defined by the
 parameters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Comparisons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For every type of observation, the observe function can be accompanied by
 a comparison function, compare(p).
 This generates a vector of analytic solutions or experimental data which
 is compared to the stochastic results.
 Results are plotted as additional lines on the two-dimensional graphical
 outputs, and comparison differences can be graphed in any dimension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparisons are possible for either moments or probabilities, and can be
 input in any number of dimensions.
 When there are error estimates, a chi-squared test is carried out to determine
 if the difference is within the expected step-size and sampling error bars.
 If the comparison has errors, for example from experimental data, the chi-squar
ed test will include the experimental errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparison data can be added to the graphics files from any source.
 It must match the corresponding space-time lattice or probability bins
 that are in the graphed data.
 Note that the compare functions are specified during the simulation.
 The graphics code does not generate comparison data, as it is dedicated
 to graphics, not to generating data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Parameter table
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Graphics-parameter-table"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The complete cell array of the simulation data is passed to the xGraph program,
 along with graphics parameters for each observable, to create an extended
 graphics data structure.
 Graphics parameters have default values which are user-modifiable by editing
 the xgpreferences function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some input parameters are global parameters for all graphs.
 However, most xGraph parameters are cell arrays indexed by graph index.
 These graphics parameters are individually set for each output that is
 plotted, using the cell index 
\begin_inset Formula $\{n\}$
\end_inset

 in a curly bracket.
 If present they replace the global parameters like labels.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a graph index is omitted, and the parameter is not a nested array, the
 program will use the same value for all graphs.
 The axes, glabels, legends, lines, logs, and xfunctions of each graph are
 nested cell arrays, as there can be any number of lines and axis dimensions.
 In the case of the logs switch, the observable axis is treated as an extra
 dimension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plotted result can be an arbitrary function of the generated average
 data, by using the optional input gfunction.
 If this is omitted, the generated average data that is input is plotted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparisons are plotted if present in the input data indexed by the last
 or check index 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $c>errors$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $errors=3$
\end_inset

 is the usual maximum value.
 
\end_layout

A table of the graphics parameters is given below.

\begin_layout Itemize
There are up to 6 types of input data, with errors and comparisons, indexed
 by the last index.
 The original mean data always has c =1.
 If there are no errors or comparisons, one graph is plotted for each dimensiona
l reduction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The data has up to two error bars (I and II), and optional comparisons with
 up to two error bars.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Type I errors labeled 
\begin_inset Formula $c=2$
\end_inset

 have standard vertical error bars.
 Type II errors labeled 
\begin_inset Formula $c=3$
\end_inset

, which are usually standard deviation errors from sampling, have two solid
 lines.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If esample = -1, the error bars are combined and the RMS errors are plotted
 as a single error bar.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If 
\begin_inset Formula $diffplot>0$
\end_inset

, differences are plotted as unnormalized (
\begin_inset Formula $diffplot=1$
\end_inset

), or normalized (
\begin_inset Formula $diffplot=2$
\end_inset

) by the total RMS errors.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $diffplot=3$
\end_inset

, raw comparison data is plotted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When differences are plotted, the total comparison errors have type I error
 bars while total simulation errors have type II errors with parallel lines,
 in order to distinguish them.

xGraph data arrays
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data input to xGraph can come from a file, or from data generated directly
 from any compatible program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data is stored in a cell array 
\begin_inset Formula $data$
\end_inset

 with structure: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
data\{s\}\{n\}(\ell,\mathbf{j},c)
\]

\end_inset

Each member of the outer cell array data{s} defines a number of related
 sets of graphical data, all described by common parameters input{s}.
 Comparisons and errors are plotted if there are errors and comparison data
 in the input, indexed by c.
 This generates comparison plots, as well as error totals and 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

- squared error estimate when there are statistical variances available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An individual member of data{s}{n} is a multidimensional array, called a
 graph in the xSPDE User's guide.
 For each graph, multiple different plots with different dimensionality
 can be obtained from the dataset data{s}{n}, either through projections
 and slices or by generating additional data defined with graphics functions.
 Either or both alternatives are available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If a sequence has one member, the outer cell array can be omitted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In this simplified case, if there is only one graph array, the inner cell
 array can be omitted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graphics data for a single dataset is held in a multidimensional real
 array, where: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 is the index for lines in the graph.
 Even for one line, the first dimension is retained.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{j}=j_{1},\ldots j_{d}$
\end_inset

 is the array index in each dimension, where 
\begin_inset Formula $d\ge1$
\end_inset

.

If integrals or spatial averages are used, the corresponding dimension has
 one index 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{d}=1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
With probabilities, extra dimensions are added to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{j}$
\end_inset

 to store the bin indices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
c indexes error-checks and comparisons.
 If not present, omit p.errors and the last dimension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If 
\begin_inset Formula $c>p.errors$
\end_inset

, the extra fields are comparison inputs, where 
\begin_inset Formula $p.errors$
\end_inset

 is the largest data index.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the optional comparison fields are used, an input parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $errors$
\end_inset

 is required to indicate the maximum error index, to distinguish data from
 comparisons.
 Parameter structures from xSIM have 
\begin_inset Formula $errors=3$
\end_inset

 set to allow for both sampling errors and discretization errors.
 If this is omitted, the default is 
\begin_inset Formula $errors=0$
\end_inset

, which implies that there is no error or comparison data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $errors>0$
\end_inset

, the last index can have larger values with 
\begin_inset Formula $c>errors$
\end_inset

, for comparisons.
 The special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $errors=1$
\end_inset

 is used if the data has no error bars, but there are comparisons in the
 data.
 Larger indices are used to index the comparison data, which can also have
 two types of errors.
 The largest usable last index is 
\begin_inset Formula $errors+3$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to directly plot the raw data using xGraph.
 One can even combine the raw data with a graphics parameter input.
 But since the raw data has no error estimates - it is raw data - one must
 set 
\begin_inset Formula $p.errors=0$
\end_inset

, since the xsim output parameters have a normal setting of 
\begin_inset Formula $p.errors=3$
\end_inset

.
 This will give a single trajectory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the raw data from a simulation typically includes many trajectories
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $ensembles(1)>0$
\end_inset

.
 One must select particular trajectory datasets from the raw cell array,
 to plot just one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Input parameters and defaults
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A sequence of graph parameters is obtained from inputs in a cell array,
 as input = {in1, in2, ...}.
 The input parameters of each simulation in the sequence are specified in
 a Matlab structure.
 The inputs are numbers, vectors, strings, functions and cell arrays.
 All metadata has preferred values, so only changes from the preferences
 need to be input.
 The resulting data is stored internally as a sequence of structures in
 a cell array, to describe the simulation sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graphics parameters are also stored in the cell array input as a sequence
 of structures p.
 This only need to be input when the graphs are generated and can be changed
 at a later time to alter the graphics output.
 A sequence of simulations is graphed from input specifications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there is one simulation, just one structure can be input, without the
 sequence braces.
 The standard way to input each parameter value is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p.label=parameter
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard way to input a function handle is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p.label=@function
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inputs are scalar or vector parameters or function handles.
 Quantities relating to graphed averages are cell arrays, indexed by the
 graph number.
 The available inputs, with their default values in brackets, are given
 below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulation metadata, including default values that were used in a particular
 simulation, can be included in the input data files.
 This is done in both the .mat and the .h5 output files generated by xSIM,
 so the entire graphics input can be reconstructed or changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parameters can be numbers, vectors, strings or cell arrays.
 Conventions that are used are that: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All input parameters have default values 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vector inputs of numbers are enclosed in square brackets, [...].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cell arrays of strings, functions or vectors are enclosed in curly brackets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vector or cell array inputs with only one member don’t require brackets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Incomplete parameter inputs are completed with the last used default value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Function definitions can be handles pointing elsewhere, or defined inline.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If any inputs are omitted, there are default values which are set by the
 internal function xgpreferences.
 The defaults can be changed by editing xgpreferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following descriptions, graphs is the total number of graphed variables
 of all types.
 The space coordinate, image, image-type and transverse data can be omitted
 if there is no spatial lattice, that is, if the dimension variable is set
 to one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For uniformity, the graphics parameters that reference an individual data
 object are cell arrays.
 These are indexed over the graph number using braces {}.
 If a different type of input is used, like a scalar or matrix, xSPDE will
 attempt to convert the type to a cell array.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Axis labels are cell arrays, indexed over dimension.
 The graph number used to index these cell arrays refers to the data object.
 In each case there can be multiple generated plots, depending on the graphics
 input.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cascaded plots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The xGraph function generates a default range of graphs, but this can be
 modified to suit the user.
 In the simplest case of one dimension, one graph dataset will generate
 a single plot.
 For higher dimensions, a cascade of plots is generated to allow visualization,
 starting from 3D movies, then 3D static plots and finally 2D slices.
 These can also be user modified.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that for all probabilities, the plot dimension is increased by the
 bin range dimensionality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Plot dimensions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pdimension input sets the maximum plotted dimensions.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $pdimension\{1\}=1$
\end_inset

 means that only plots vs 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}$
\end_inset

 are output for the first function plotted.
 Default values are used for the non-plotted dimensions, unless there are
 axes specified, as indicated below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graphs cascade down from higher to lower dimensions, generating different
 types of graphs.
 Each type of graph is generated once for each function index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Plot axes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graphics axes that are used for plotting and the points plotted are
 defined using the optional axes
\series bold
 
\series default
input parameters, where 
\begin_inset Formula $axes\{n\}$
\end_inset

 indicates the n-th specified graph or set of generated graph data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there are no axes
\series bold
 
\series default
inputs, or the axes inputs are zero - for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $axes\{1\}=\{0,0,0\}$
\end_inset

 - only the lowest dimensions are plotted, up to 3.
 If either the data or axes
\series bold
 
\series default
inputs project one point in a given dimension, - for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $axes\{1\}=\{0,31,-1,0\}$
\end_inset

, this dimension is suppressed in the plots, which reduces the effective
 dimension of the data - in this case to two dimensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $axes\{1\}=\{0\}$
\end_inset

 - For function 1, plot all the first dimensional points; higher dimensions
 get defaults.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $axes\{2\}=\{-2,0\}$
\end_inset

 - For function 2, plot the maximum value of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}$
\end_inset

 (the default) and all higher-dimensional x-points.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $axes\{3\}=\{1:4:51,32,64\}$
\end_inset

 - For function 3, plot every 4-th 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 point at 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 point 32, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{3}$
\end_inset

 point 64 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $axes\{4\}=\{0,2:4:48,0\}$
\end_inset

 - For function 4, plot every 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 point , every 4-th 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 point, and all 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{3}$
\end_inset

-points.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Points labelled 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 indicates a default `typical' point, which is the midpoint.
 If one uses 
\begin_inset Formula $-2$
\end_inset

, this is the last point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lower dimensions are replaced by corresponding higher dimensions if there
 are dimensions or axes that are suppressed.
 Slices can be taken at any desired point, not just the midpoint.
 The notation of 
\begin_inset Formula $axes\{1\}=\{6:3:81\}$
\end_inset

, is used to modify the starting, interval, and finishing points for complete
 control on the plot points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graphics results depend on the resulting 
\series bold
effective
\series default
 dimension, which is equal to the actual input data dimension unless there
 is an axes suppression, described above.
 Since the plot has to include a data axis, the plot itself will usually
 have an extra data axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can plot only three axes directly using standard graphics tools.
 The strategy to deal with the higher effective dimensionality is as follows.
 For simplicity, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used to label the first effective dimension, although in fact any first
 dimension is possible: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
dimensions
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

1 For one lattice dimension, a 2D plot of observable vs t is plotted, with
 data at each lattice point in time.
 Exact results, error bars and sampling error bounds are included if available.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
dimensions
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2 For two lattice dimensions, a 3D image of observable vs x,t is plotted.
 A movie of distinct 2D graphic plots is also possible.
 Otherwise, a slice through 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 is used tp reduce the lattice dimension to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
dimensions
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

3 For three lattice dimensions, if 
\begin_inset Formula $images>1$
\end_inset

, a movie of distinct 3D graphic images of observables are plotted as 
\begin_inset Formula $images$
\end_inset

 slices versus the first plot dimension.
 Otherwise, a slice through the chosen point, is used at the highest dimension
 to reduce the lattice dimension to 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
dimensions
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

4,5..
 For higher lattice dimensions, a slice through a chosen point, or the default
 midpoint is used to reduce the lattice dimension to 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explained above, in addition to graphs versus 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 the 
\series bold
xGraph
\series default
 function can generate images (3D) and transverse (2D) plots at specified
 points, up to a maximum given by the number of points specified.
 The number of these can be individually specified for each graph number.
 The images available are specified as imagetype
\begin_inset Formula $=1,\ldots4$
\end_inset

, giving: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
3D perspective plots (Matlab surf - the default) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
2D filled color plots (Matlab contourf ) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
contour plots (Matlab contour ) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
pseudo-color plots (Matlab pcolor ) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Error bars, sampling errors and multiple lines for comparisons are only
 graphed for 2D plots.
 Error-bars are not plotted when they are below a user-specified size, with
 a default of 
\begin_inset Formula $1\%$
\end_inset

 of the maximum range, to improve graphics quality.
 Higher dimensional graphs do not output error-bars, but they are still
 recorded in the data files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Probabilities and parametric plots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Probability data can be input and plotted like any other data.
 It is typically generated from simulation programs using the 
\begin_inset Formula $binranges$
\end_inset

 data for binning.
 It is plotted like any other graph, with any dimension, except that the
 total dimension is extended by the number of variables or lines in the
 observe function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Chi-squared plots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition the program can make a 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 plot, which is a plot of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 comparison with a comparison probability density against space and/or time.
 This allows a test of the simulated data against a known target probability
 distribution, provided that the following input data conditions are satisfied:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The input data dimension exceeds the p.dimensions parameter, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The switch p.chisqplot is set to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

or 2, and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The input data includes comparison function data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 plots, depending on 
\begin_inset Formula $p.chisqplot$
\end_inset

 are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
a plot of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the number of valid data points, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
a plot of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2\chi^{2}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2k-1}$
\end_inset

, which should have a unit variance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, for one point in space and time, with 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 bins, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{j}$
\end_inset

 counts per bin and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{j}$
\end_inset

 expected counts: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\chi^{2}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\frac{\left(N_{j}-E_{j}\right)^{2}}{E_{j}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the number of valid counts, with 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{j},E_{j}>mincount$
\end_inset

.
 This is partly determined from the requirement that the probability count
 data per bin is greater than the 
\begin_inset Formula $p.mincount$
\end_inset

 parameter.
 The default is set to give a number of samples 
\begin_inset Formula $>10$
\end_inset

.
 The program prints a summary that sums over of all the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $p.scale\{n\}$
\end_inset

 parameter gives the number of counts per bin at unit probability density.
 This is needed to set the scale of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 results, ie, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{j}=scale\{n\}\times p_{j}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the probability density that is compared and plotted in the simulation
 data.
 Note that a uniform bin size is assumed here, to give a uniform scaling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Comparisons with variances
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be useful to compare two probability distributions with different
 variances.
 For one point in space and time, with 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 bins, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j}$
\end_inset

 probability density and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{j}$
\end_inset

 expected probability density, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\chi^{2}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\frac{\left(p_{j}-e_{j}\right)^{2}}{\sigma_{j}^{2}+\sigma_{e,j}^{2}}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{j}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{e,j}^{2}$
\end_inset

 are the sampling errors in the simulation data and comparison data, so
 that built-in error fields in the data are used to work out the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 results.
 This option is chosen if 
\begin_inset Formula $p.scale\{n\}=0$
\end_inset

, and the cutoff for the data is then specified so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j},e_{j}>p.cutoffs\{n\}$
\end_inset

.
 This only has a 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 distribution if points are independent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Maximum likelihood
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also possible to plot the 
\begin_inset Formula $G^{2}$
\end_inset

 or maximum likelihood plot of the data, which is an alternative means to
 compare distributions, where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
G^{2}=2\sum_{j=1}^{m}N_{j}\ln\left(N_{j}/E_{j}\right).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The expected values 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{j}$
\end_inset

 are automatically scaled so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum N_{j}=\sum E_{j},$
\end_inset

with the same minimum count cutoff that is used for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 data.
 The result is similar to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 results.
 It is obtained if p.gsqplot is set to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 or 2 and requires for the input that 
\begin_inset Formula $p.scale\{n\}>0.$
\end_inset

 It is sometimes regarded as a preferred method for comparisons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Parametric plots
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any input dataset can be converted to a parametric plot, where a second
 data input is plotted along the horizontal axis instead of the time coordinate.
 It is also possible to substitute a second data input for the x-axis data
 if a parametric plot in space is required instead.
 This allows visualization of how one type of data changes as a function
 of a second type of data input.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two datasets that are plotted must have the same number of lines, that
 is, the first index range should be the same, in order that multiple lines
 can be compared.
 This is achieved where required using the p.scatters input in the simulation
 code.
 The details of the parametric plot are specified using the input: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p.parametric\{n\}=[n1,p2]
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the graph number which is plotted, and must correspond to an input dataset.
 The number 
\begin_inset Formula $n1$
\end_inset

 is the graph number of the observable that is plotted on the horizontal
 axis, ignoring functional transformations.
 The second number is the axis number where the parametric value is substituted,
 which can be the time (axis 1) or the x-coordinate (axis 2), if present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all cases the vertical axis is used to plot the original data.
 The specified horizontal axis is used for the parametric variable.
 Only vertical error-bars are available.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
axes{n}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Default: {0,0,0,..} 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gives the axis points plotted for the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-th plotted function, in each dimension.
 Each entry value is a vector range for a particular plot and dimension.
 Thus, p = 5 gives the fifth point only, and a vector input p = 1:4:41 plots
 every fourth point.
 Single points generate graphics projections, allowing the other dimensions
 to be plotted.
 Zero or negative values are shorthand.
 For example, p = -1 generates a default point at the midpoint, p = -2 the
 endpoint, and p = 0 is the default value that gives the vector for the
 every axis point.
 For each graph type, i.e.
 n=1,..graphs the axes can be individually specified in each dimension, d=1,..dimens
ions.
 If more than three axes are specified to be vectors, only the first three
 are used, and others are set to default values in the plots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: p.axes{4} = {1:2:10,0,0,-1} 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
diffplot{n}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Default: 0 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Differences are plotted as a comparison dashed line on 
\begin_inset Formula $2D$
\end_inset

 plots as a default.
 Otherwise, a separate difference plot is obtained which is unnormalized
 (diffplot = 1), or normalized (diffplot = 2) by the total RMS errors.
 If diffplot = 3, the comparison data is plotted directly as an additional
 graph.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: p.diffplot{3} = 2 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Default: 0 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indicates if the last index in the graphics input data arrays is used for
 error-bars and/or comparisons.
 Should be set to zero if there is no error or comparison data.
 If non-zero, this will give the highest last index used for errors.
 The standard xsim output sets 
\begin_inset Formula $p.errors=3$
\end_inset

 automatically.
 As a special case, 
\begin_inset Formula $p.errors=1$
\end_inset

 is used to indicate that there is comparison data but no error data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $p.errors>0$
\end_inset

 , the data indexed up to p.errors gives the data, then a maximum of two
 types of error bars.
 Up to three further index values, up to 
\begin_inset Formula $p.errors+3$
\end_inset

, are available to index all comparison data and its error fields.
 The maximum last index value used is 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: p.errors = 2 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
esample{n}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Default: 1 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sets the type and size of sampling errors that are plotted.
 If esample = 0, no sampling error lines are plotted, just the mean.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $esample=-n$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm n\sigma$
\end_inset

 sampling errors are included in the error-bars.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $esample=n$
\end_inset

, separate upper and lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm n\sigma$
\end_inset

 sampling error lines are plotted.
 In both cases, the magnitude of esample sets the number of standard deviations
 used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: p.esample{3} = -1 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
font{n}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Default: 18 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sets the default font sizes for the graph labels, indexed by graph.
 This can be changed per graph.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: p.font{4}=18 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Default: number of functional transformations 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This gives the maximum number of output graph functions and is available
 to restrict graphical output.
 The default is the length of the cell array of input data.
 Normally, the default will be used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: p.functions = 10 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
glabels{n}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Default: xlabels or klabels 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graph-dependent labels for the independent variable labels.
 This is a nested cell array with first dimension of graphs and second dimension
 of dimensions.
 This is used to replace the global values of xlabels or klabels if the
 axis labels change from graph to graph, for example, if the coordinates
 have a functional transform.
 These can be set for an individual coordinate on one graph if needed.
 
\end_layout

Example: p.glabels{4}{2} = 'x^2' 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Default: observables to plot 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This gives the observables to plot.
 The default is a vector of indices from one to the length of the cell array
 of observe functions.
 Normally not initialized, as the default is used.
 Mostly used to reduce graphical output on a long file.
 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Default: [0,0,...]

\begin_layout Standard
This switch specifies the Fourier transformed graphs and axes for graphics
 labeling.
 Automatically equal to ftransforms if from an earlier xSIM input, but can
 be changed.
 If altered for a given graph, all the axis Fourier switches should be reset.
 This is ignored if there is no dimensions setting to indicate space dimensions.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a string variable giving the graph headers for each type of function
 plotted.
 The default value is an empty string.
 Otherwise, the header string that is input is used.
 Either is combined with the simulation name and a graph number to identify
 the graph.
 This is used to include simulation headers to identify graphs in simulation
 outputs.
 Graph headers may not be needed in a final published result.
 For this, either edit the graph, or use a space to make plot headers blank:
 p.headers{n} = ' ', or p.name = ' ' .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: p.headers{n} = 'my_graph_header' 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Default: {0,0,0,0; ...} 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graph-dependent limits specified as a cell array with dimension graphs.
 Each entry is a cell array of graph limits indexed by the dimension, starting
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $d=1$
\end_inset

 for the time dimension.
 The limits are vectors, indexed as 1,2 for the lower and upper plot limits.
 This is useful if the limits required change from graph to graph.
 If an automatic limit is required for either the upper or lower limit,
 it is set to inf.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An invalid, scalar or empty limit vector, like [0,0] or

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Line types for each line in every two-dimensional graph plotted.
 If a given line on a two-dimensional line is to be removed completely,
 set the relevant line-style to zero.
 For example, to remove the first line from graph 3, set p.linestyle{3} ={0}.
 This is useful when generating and changing graphics output from a saved
 data file.
 The linestyle uses Matlab terminology.
 It allows setting the line pattern, marker symbols and color for every
 line.
 The default lines are black ('k'), but any other color can be used instead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The specifiers must be chosen from the list below, eg, '-ok', although the
 marker can be omitted if not required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Line patterns: '-' (solid), '–' (dashed), ':' (dotted) ,'-.' (dash-dot)

 For example, to make the lines wider in graph 3, set p.linewidth{3} =1.
 This is useful for changing graphics output appearance if the default lines
 are too thin.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: p.linewidth{n} = 1 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
minbar{n}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Default: {0.01, ...} 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the minimum relative error-bar that is plotted.
 Set to a large value to suppress unwanted error-bars, although its best
 not to ignore the error-bar information! This can be changed per graph.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: p.minbar{n} = 0 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
name
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Default: 
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Name used to label simulation graphs, usually corresponding to the equation
 or problem solved.
 This can be removed from individual graphs by using headers{n} equal to
 a single blank space.
 The default is a null string.
 To remove all headers globally, set name equal to a single blank space:
 name = ' '.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: p.name = 'Wiener process simulation' 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
olabels{n}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Default: 'a' 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cell array of labels for the graph axis observables and functions.
 These are text labels that are used on the graph axes.
 The default value is 'a_1' if the default observable is used, otherwise
 it is blank.
 This is overwritten by any subsequent label input when the graphics program
 is run: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: p.olabels{4} = 'v' 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
parametric{n}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Default: [0,0] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cell array that defines parametric plots, for each graph number.
 The first number is the graph number of the alternative observable plotted
 on the horizontal axis.
 The second number is the axis number where the parametric value is substituted,
 which can be the time (axis 1) or the x-coordinate (axis 2), if present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If both are zero, the plot against an independent space-time coordinate
 is calculated as usual.
 If nonzero, a parametric plot is made for two-dimensional plots.
 In all cases the vertical axis is used to plot the original data.
 The specified horizontal axis is used for the parametric variable.
 Only vertical error-bars are available.
 Can be usefully combined with scatters{n} to plot individual trajectories,
 but the number of scatters should be the same in each of the two graphs
 that are parametrically plotted against each other.

pdimension{n}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Default: 3 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the maximum plotted space-time dimension for each plotted quantity.
 The purpose is eliminate unwanted graphs.
 For example, it is useful to reduce the maximum dimension when averaging
 in space.
 Higher dimensional graphs are not needed, as the data is duplicated.
 Averaging can be useful for checking conservation laws, or for averaging
 over homogeneous data to reduce sampling errors.
 All graphs are suppressed if it is set to zero.
 Any three dimensions can be chosen to be plotted, using the axes parameter
 to suppress the unwanted data points in other dimensions.

This is the number of 2D transverse images plotted as discrete time slices.
 Only valid if dimensions is greater than 2.
 If present, the 
\begin_inset Formula $y,z$
\end_inset

-coordinates are set to their central values when plotting transverse images.
 Each element can be from 0 up to the number of plotted time-points.
 The cell array has a vector length equal to graphs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: p.transverse{n}= 6 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
verbose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Default: 0 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Print flag for output information while running xGraph.
 Print options are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Minimal if verbose = -1: Prints just the start-up time and hard error messages
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Brief if verbose = 0: Additionally prints the final, total chi-squared errors
 where present 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Informative if verbose = 1: Also prints the graph progress indicators 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Full if verbose = 2: Prints everything including the internal parameter
 structure data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, if verbose = 0, most output is suppressed except the final data,
 verbose = 1 displays a progress report, and verbose = 2 additionally generates
 a readable summary of the graphics parameter input.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: p.verbose = 0 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
xlabels
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

 dimensions.
 The numerical labeling default is used when the numberaxis option is true.
 These are typeset in Latex mathematics mode.
 When changing from the default values, all the required new labels must
 be set.
 
\end_layout

Example: p.xlabels = {'tau'} 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
User function reference
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to simply run xGraph as is, without much intervention.
 However, there are customization options, including user defined functions.
 These are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
gfunction{n} (d,p)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a cell array of graphics function handles.
 Use when a graph is needed that is a functional transformation of the observed
 averages.
 The default value generates the n-th graph data array directly from the
 n-th input data.
 The input is the data cell array for all the graphs in the current sequence
 number with their graph parameters x, and the output is the n-th data array
 that is plotted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An arbitrary number of functions of these observables can be plotted, including
 vector observables.
 The input to graphics functions is the observed data averages or functions
 of averages in a given sequence, each stored in a cell array 
\begin_inset Formula $d\{n\}(\ell,\mathbf{j},c)$
\end_inset

.
 If there are more graphics functions than input data cells, this generate
 additional data for plotting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
xfunctions{n} {nd} (ax,p)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a nested cell array of axis transformations.
 Use when a graph is needed with an axis that is a function of the original
 axes.
 The input is the original axis coordinates, and the output is the new coordinat
e set.
 The default value generates the input axes.
 Called as xfunctions{n}{nd}(ax,p) for the n-th graph and axis direction
 dir, where ax is a vector of coordinates for that axis.There is one graphics
 function for each separate graph dimension or axis.
 The default value is the coordinate vector 
\begin_inset Formula $xk\{nd\}$
\end_inset

 stored in the input parameter structure p, or else the relevant index if
 xk{nd} is omitted.
